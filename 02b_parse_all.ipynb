For the purpose of this project, this means bills that originated in the House of Representatives (indicated as \"bills/hr\" within the path) within the Congressional sessions of interest (indicated using range of 111-116 under the variable, *n*. Eventually we will narrow this list to only bills that were signed into law, and since all bills signed into law must pass both the House of Representatives and the Senate, grabbing only HR bills will be sufficient. Other less substantive types of legislation that we aren't interested in, such as resolutions and proclamations, are also weeded out though this process. \n",
