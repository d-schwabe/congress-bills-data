This bill provides support for recycling programs.

Specifically, the bill requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish a program to award grants to improve the effectiveness of residential and community recycling programs through public education and outreach.

In addition, the EPA must develop a model recycling program toolkit for states, Native American tribes, and local governments.

Finally, the bill specifies that the EPA's review of its federal procurement guidelines for&#160;purchasing certain recycled materials and items made with such materials must occur at least once every five years.</summary>
