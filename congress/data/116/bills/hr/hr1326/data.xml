The bill reauthorizes through FY2024 the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation and the Chesapeake Bay Program and the Chesapeake Bay Initiative.

The bill establishes the National Fish Habitat Board and the Wildlife and Hunting Heritage Conservation Council Advisory Committee on wildlife and habitat conservation, hunting, and recreational shooting.
