Under current law, states may use TANF funds to support other state programs only if they are related to Child Care and Development Block Grants or Social Services Block Grants.\n\nStates must negotiate with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish a level of performance for each indicator, taking into account certain economic, demographic, and other factors. HHS must periodically revise levels of performance for states to reflect economic and other conditions."
