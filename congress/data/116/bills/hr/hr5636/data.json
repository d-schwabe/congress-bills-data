The disclosures are those described in the Sustainability Accounting Standard for the Renewable Resources & Alternative Energy Sector or the Extractives & Mineral Processing Sector.\n\nEvery two years, Interior must submit a report to Congress that includes, among other things (1) for fossil fuel operations on public lands, the annual and two-year totals of greenhouse gas emissions, air quality, water management, biodiversity impacts, production, and the number of sites according to the metrics specified in the Sustainability Accounting Standard for Oil & Gas - Exploration & Production; and (2) for renewable energy operations on public lands, greenhouse gas emissions that would result from the production of the same amount of energy using fossil fuels."
