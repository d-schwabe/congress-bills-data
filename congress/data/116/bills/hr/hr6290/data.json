The taxpayer must be 18 years of age in 2020, a resident of the United States, and not a dependent of another taxpayer. A dependent child under age 18 shall receive a $500 credit amount. The credit is denied to certain top income earners.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service must establish an expedited process to assist taxpayers in applying for such credit.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office must report annually to Congress on alternative fiscal policies to improve readiness for future economic downturns caused by depressions, pandemics, and climate change catastrophes."
