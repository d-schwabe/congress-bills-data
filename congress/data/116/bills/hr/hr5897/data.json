The CMS must also (1) develop and publish a standardized complaint form for such facilities; and (2) convene an advisory council to recommend ways to prevent abuse, neglect, and exploitation in such facilities.\n\nThe bill also allows Medicaid and Medicare providers (e.g., skilled nursing facilities) to access, through the National Practitioner Data Bank, disciplinary information for affiliated physicians and other health care practitioners, as reported by state licensing authorities."
