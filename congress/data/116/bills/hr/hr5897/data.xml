  <summary date="2020-02-13T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Preventing Abuse and Neglect of Vulnerable Americans Act of 2020

This bill requires the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) to publish specified information on its website relating to deficiencies of Medicaid intermediate care facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities, including information regarding inspections, complaints, and administrative actions. The CMS must also (1) develop and publish a standardized complaint form for such facilities; and (2) convene an advisory council to recommend ways to prevent abuse, neglect, and exploitation in such facilities.

The bill also allows Medicaid and Medicare providers (e.g., skilled nursing facilities) to access, through the National Practitioner Data Bank, disciplinary information for affiliated physicians and other health care practitioners, as reported by state licensing authorities.</summary>
