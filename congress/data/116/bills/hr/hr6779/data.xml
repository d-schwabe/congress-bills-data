  <summary date="2020-05-08T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill extends to specified loan applicants certain eligibility requirements for participation in SBA programs that currently apply only to intermediaries (entities that borrow funds from the Small Business Administration to make loans to small businesses).

Specifically, the bill applies eligibility requirements for intermediaries that are based on illegal activity to any applicant for a loan under the Paycheck Protection Program established to support small businesses in response to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019).</summary>
