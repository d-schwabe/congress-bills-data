The department or agency may condition the grant award on the prohibition of an individual for whom a report has been filed from using the grant award or carrying out activities under the grant.\n\nThe National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine must study and report on the implementation and effectiveness of strategies employed to address and prevent sexual harassment."
