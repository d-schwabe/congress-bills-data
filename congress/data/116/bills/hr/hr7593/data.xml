This bill modifies requirements relating to coverage of certain telehealth services under Medicare. Specifically, the bill permanently allows telehealth services for substance-use disorders to be provided via audio-only technology, if a physician or practitioner has already conducted an in-person or video telehealth evaluation. Schedule III or IV controlled substances may also be prescribed online if a practitioner has conducted a telehealth evaluation with video.</summary>
