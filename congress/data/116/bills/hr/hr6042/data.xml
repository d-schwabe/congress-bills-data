This bill declares that (1) human life is deemed to exist from fertilization, without regard to race, sex, age, health, defect, or condition of dependency; and (2) "person" includes all such human life.

The bill recognizes that each state has a compelling interest in protecting the lives of those within the state's jurisdiction whom the state rationally regards as human beings.

The bill amends the federal judicial code to remove Supreme Court and district court jurisdiction to review cases arising out of any statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, or practice, or any act interpreting such a measure on the grounds that such measure (1) protects the rights of human persons between conception and birth; or (2) prohibits, limits, or regulates the performance of abortions or the provision of public funds, facilities, personnel, or other assistance for abortions.</summary>
