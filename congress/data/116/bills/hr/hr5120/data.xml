  <summary date="2019-11-15T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Safe, Accountable, Fair, and Environmentally Responsible Pipelines Act of 2019 or the SAFER Pipelines Act of 2019

This bill addresses pipeline safety with respect to natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines.

Among other things, the bill

 reauthorizes appropriations through FY2023 for pipeline safety activities; prioritizes assessment methods for transmission pipelines that can provide a greater level of safety than direct assessment, including the use of internal inspection devices or pressure testing; makes it mandatory for each operator of a transmission pipeline facility in a high consequence area to install automatic or remote shutoff valves; directs owners and operators of gas or hazardous liquid pipeline facilities to make critical operational information available to surrounding communities and first responders; increases civil penalties for violations and revises the criminal penalty standard from knowingly and willfully to knowingly or recklessly; requires advanced leak-detection that can identify leak locations and amounts released on gas pipelines; and directs the Department of Transportation to finalize a rule on gas gathering lines.</summary>
