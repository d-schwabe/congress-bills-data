  <summary date="2020-07-29T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">The American PPE Supply Chain Integrity Act

This bill requires the federal government to purchase medical supplies and personal protective equipment from the United States, with exceptions for small purchases.

 Specifically, the bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Veterans Affairs to purchase specified medical supplies (including disinfecting wipes and natural fiber products) and personal protective equipment (including surgical masks, face shields, and foot coverings) from products that are 100% grown, reprocessed, reused, or produced in the United States.

The bill makes an exception for purchases for amounts not greater than $150,000.

The bill applies the Berry Amendment (which requires the Department of Defense to give preference in procurement to domestically produced, manufactured, or home-grown products) to specified supplies and equipment, such as surgical dressing materials, hospital and surgical clothing, and textile medical supplies and equipment.</summary>
