  <summary date="2020-07-09T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Made in America: Preparation for a Pandemic Act of 2020

This bill establishes a pandemic preparation tax credit and a requirement to maintain in the Strategic National Stockpile a specified amount of personal protective equipment (PPE).

The pandemic preparation tax credit is an amount equal to 20% of the qualified expenses paid or incurred by the taxpayer for purposes of producing PPE that qualifies for addition to the Strategic National Stockpile.

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) shall ensure that the stockpile includes an amount of PPE sufficient to meet the health security needs of the United States for one year during a pandemic or other emergency.

The bill requires that at least 25% of the PPE in the stockpile be produced domestically, with exceptions. If the OMB determines that the requirement is not satisfied, it shall (1) notify specified congressional committees on a quarterly basis, and (2) post each notification on a General Services Administration website.</summary>
