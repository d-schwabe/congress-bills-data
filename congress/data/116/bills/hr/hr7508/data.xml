  <summary date="2020-07-09T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill provides FY2020 supplemental appropriations to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for maintaining the projected FY2020 and FY2021 levels of operations for immigration adjudication and naturalization services, including maintaining current staffing levels and current contracts at full performance.

The bill designates the appropriations as emergency spending, which is exempt from discretionary spending limits.

The bill also requires USCIS to add a 10% surcharge to premium processing fees for employment-based petitions and applications until the additional fees collected equal the amount of supplemental appropriations provided by this bill.</summary>
