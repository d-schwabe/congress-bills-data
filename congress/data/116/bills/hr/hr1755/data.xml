This bill terminates a declaration of national&#160;emergency made by the President after 30 days unless Congress votes to extend the declaration. (Currently, Congress can cancel an emergency declaration only by passing a resolution that can withstand a presidential veto.)

The bill establishes procedures for congressional review of declarations of national emergencies.

The President shall (1) transmit specified information to Congress with any proclamation declaring or renewing a national emergency, including a description of the circumstances necessitating the declaration or renewal of a national emergency&#160;declaration&#160;and its estimated duration; and (2) report periodically on the status of the emergency.</summary>
