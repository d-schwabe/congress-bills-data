This bill provides 100% of temporary federal financing of limited short-time compensation (STC) payments in states with existing or new STC programs. (STC, also known as work sharing, is a program within the federal-state unemployment system that provides pro-rated unemployment compensation to workers whose hours have been reduced in lieu of a layoff.)

Certain states without an STC program may enter into an agreement with the Department of Labor under which Labor will temporarily finance 50% of the state's STC payments. If such a state subsequently enacts a state law implementing a STC program that meets federal requirements it shall be ineligible for such 50% financing, but shall be eligible for the 100% financing. Federal financing of STC payments is limited to 260 weeks.

Labor must

 award grants to states that enact STC programs to implement or improve administration of such programs and promote and enroll employers in STC programs; develop and provide model legislative language for states&#160;to develop and enact STC programs, including periodically reviewing and revising such language; provide technical assistance and guidance in developing, enacting, and implementing STC programs; and establish certain STC reporting requirements.</summary>
