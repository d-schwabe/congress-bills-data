  <summary date="2019-07-30T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Build Local, Hire Local Act

This bill requires certain employment practices for specified federally assisted infrastructure projects and creates several infrastructure related grant programs.

Among other things, this bill requires these projects to

 hire a certain percentage of local workers, with priority given to individuals with a barrier to employment, veterans, and individuals from populations that are traditionally underrepresented in the infrastructure workforce; expend a certain percentage of funds received through a small business concern and subcontract a certain percentage of projects through a small business concern; and expend a certain percentage of funds received through businesses owned and controlled by socially or economically disadvantaged individuals, women, veterans, LGBTQ individuals, disabled individuals, or ex-offenders. Further, all laborers, mechanics, and service employees employed by contractors or subcontractors on these projects must be paid wages at rates equal to those prevailing on projects of a similar character in the locality. Recipients of funds for these projects must also develop and maintain workforce diversity programs to ensure equal employment opportunities.

In addition, the Department of Transportation, in coordination with other specified federal agencies, must establish a grant program to provide grants to eligible entities for various infrastructure related projects to create connected, economically prosperous, and environmentally and physically healthy communities. Similarly, the Department of Labor, in consultation with other specified federal agencies, must establish a grant program to provide grants to eligible entities to carry out job training programs to ensure a pipeline of qualified workers in targeted infrastructure industries.</summary>
