A rural incumbent local exchange carrier is a carrier that serves an area where it is required to provide communications services to any customer regardless of cost, and an area other than an urbanized area with not fewer than 50,000 periople, and a core where there are not fewer than 1,000 people per square mile. The bill requires recapture of tax for income from the sale or exchange of stock in a carrier not held for at least one year.\n\nThe bill allows an investment tax credit for 30% of expenditures to purchase, maintain, or improve property to provide voice telephone service or broadband internet access in rural empowerment zones.\n\nThe bill increases the volume cap for private activity bonds and allows the use of bond proceeds for infrastructure for broadband internet access service."
