  <summary date="2020-09-01T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Imported Seafood Testing Act

This bill requires the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to inspect a certain amount of imported seafood each year and contains other provisions related to imported seafood.

Specifically, the FDA must inspect at least 20% of all imported seafood each year and must also inspect the first 15 shipments imported into the United States by a new exporter.

The bill also imposes various requirements and penalties for failed inspections, including by (1) requiring the destruction of a shipment that would have caused significant health risks, and (2) barring imports from a country with a pattern of failed inspections. &#160;

The bill also imposes civil penalties for knowingly making a false statement with respect to such inspections or misbranding imported seafood.</summary>
