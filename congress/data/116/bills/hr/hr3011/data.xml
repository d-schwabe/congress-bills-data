  <summary date="2019-05-23T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">End Drunk Driving Act of 2019

This bill directs the Department of Transportation (DOT) to implement federal motor vehicle safety standards that prevent operation of a motor vehicle when the operator is under the influence of alcohol.

Such standards must

 prevent the operation of the motor vehicle if the operator's blood alcohol content is above the legal limit; and require,&#160;among other things,&#160;the technology to be reliable and accurate and easily maintained. DOT must withhold specified graduated percentages of a state's apportionment of federal-aid highway funds for FY2022-FY2024 (5% in each fiscal year thereafter) if the state has not enacted and is not enforcing certain laws to prevent repeat intoxicated driving.

A state must require the installation of an ignition interlock device for a minimum of 180 days on each motor vehicle operated by an individual convicted of driving while intoxicated or driving under the influence.</summary>
