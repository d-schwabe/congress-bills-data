DOT must withhold specified graduated percentages of a state's apportionment of federal-aid highway funds for FY2022-FY2024 (5% in each fiscal year thereafter) if the state has not enacted and is not enforcing certain laws to prevent repeat intoxicated driving.\n\nA state must require the installation of an ignition interlock device for a minimum of 180 days on each motor vehicle operated by an individual convicted of driving while intoxicated or driving under the influence."
