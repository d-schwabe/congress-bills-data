  <summary date="2020-07-31T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill authorizes the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services to obtain information, assistance, and other support from federal agencies when investigating claims of information blocking by developers of, or entities offering, health information technologies.

Information blocking refers to a practice that is likely to interfere with, prevent, or materially discourage access, exchange, or use of electronic health information, such as the imposition of fees that make exchanging this information cost prohibitive.</summary>
