This bill alters eligibility standards and related processes for several programs that provide premium and cost-sharing assistance to low-income Medicare beneficiaries.

Among other things, the bill expands income eligibility for the Qualified Medicare Beneficiary Program and the Specified Low-Income Medicare Beneficiary Program to up to 135% and 200% of the federal poverty level (FPL), respectively, and provides an enhanced Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (i.e., federal matching rate) to state Medicaid programs for expenditures related to the expansion. The bill also repeals the Qualifying Individual Program (which currently provides premium assistance to beneficiaries with incomes between 120% and 135% of the FPL).</summary>
