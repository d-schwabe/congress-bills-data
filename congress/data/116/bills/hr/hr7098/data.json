The study must be conducted in accordance with criteria of the National Park Service (NPS) for boundary adjustment studies.\n\n Interior may, with the consent of Arizona and in accordance with federal and state law, acquire land or interests therein owned by the state within the boundary of the park.\n\nIf Interior is unable to acquire such state land, Interior may enter into an agreement that would allow the NPS to manage such land within the park's boundary."
