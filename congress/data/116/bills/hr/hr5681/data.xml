  <summary date="2020-01-27T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Protecting Communities from Hospital Closures Act of 2020

This bill prohibits hospitals from closing unless pursuant to a plan approved by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

Specifically, a&#160;hospital must (1) notify HHS before closing most or all of its units or departments or specific units or departments where the closure may significantly impact the health and welfare of a community (e.g., emergency departments or labor and delivery units), and (2) provide a closure plan that addresses specified issues related to continuity of patient care and the health and safety needs of the community served by the departments or units. HHS may reject, approve, or require modification of the plan.

The bill provides for certain judicial remedies in the event of closures that occur without an approved plan or in violation of an approved plan.</summary>
