  <summary date="2020-09-21T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Continuing Appropriations Act, 2021 and Other Extensions Act 

This bill provides continuing FY2021 appropriations to federal agencies through December 11, 2020, and extends several programs.

It is known as a continuing resolution (CR) and prevents a government shutdown that would otherwise occur if the FY2021 appropriations bills have not been enacted when FY2021 begins on October 1, 2020.

The CR funds most programs and activities at the FY2020 levels with several exceptions that provide funding flexibility and additional appropriations to various programs.

In addition, the bill extends several authorities and programs, including

 surface transportation programs; public health, Medicare, and Medicaid authorities and programs; several authorities related to veterans benefits; the National Flood Insurance Program; the Appalachian Regional Commission; the U.S. Parole Commission; the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program; and several authorities related to immigration. The bill also includes provisions that

 increase and expand U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services fees for providing premium processing services for certain immigration-related applications, and reauthorize a program that provides incentives (e.g., limitations on civil liability) for corporations to self-report antitrust violations to the Department of Justice.</summary>
