This bill limits the duration of a declaration of national emergency by the President, directs the President to allow certain exports to a country under sanctions, and requires the President to provide specified information when exercising emergency economic powers.

Specifically, the bill provides that any national emergency declared by the President shall terminate 60 days after the first day on which either house of Congress is in session following the declaration, unless Congress enacts a joint resolution to extend the emergency. If Congress does not enact a joint resolution to extend the emergency, the President may not declare a new national emergency based on substantially similar facts during the 1-year period following such 60-day period.

The President must allow the export of certain equipment and material to a territory that is controlled by a person that is otherwise subject to sanctions if the material is intended for (1) civilian health care facilities, (2) water infrastructure, (3) civilian energy infrastructure, or (4) primary or secondary educational facilities.

When exercising any international emergency economic powers, the President must issue a report that includes (1) the goals and outcomes expected to be achieved through such actions; (2) other tools considered to address the emergency and the reason for the chosen response; (3) a list of countries imposing similar sanctions; and (4) the strategy to provide compliance guidance to entities in the private sector, humanitarian organizations, and peace-building organizations.</summary>
