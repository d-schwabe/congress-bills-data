This bill requires Medicare Advantage (MA) plans to cover specified treatment services relating to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) without cost-sharing during the public health emergency declared on January 31, 2020. The CMS must reimburse MA plans for cost-sharing amounts that would otherwise have been received, in accordance with a specified timeline.

MA plans are also prohibited from instituting prior authorization or other utilization management requirements with respect to coverage of specified critical&#160;treatment services (e.g., ventilator services and intensive care unit services).</summary>
