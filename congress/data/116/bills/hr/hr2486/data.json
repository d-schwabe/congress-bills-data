ED may only use the disclosed information for the purposes above and for mitigating risks related to the programs. Mitigation of\u00a0risks includes conducting oversight and reducing improper payments. It does not include conducting criminal investigations or prosecutions.\n\nWith the consent of the taxpayer, ED may disclose the return information to certain institutions of higher education, state higher education agencies, and scholarship organizations solely for the use in financial aid programs.\n\nThe bill specifies notification and reporting requirements related to the disclosures and the implementation of the bill.\n\nThe bill also permanently extends funding for minority-serving institutions of higher education and increases funding for Pell Grants."
