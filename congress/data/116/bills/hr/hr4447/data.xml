  <summary date="2020-09-15T11:59:40Z" status="Reported to House, Part I">Expanding Access to Sustainable Energy Act of 2019

This bill requires the Department of Energy to award grants to assist rural electric cooperatives with identifying, evaluating, designing, and demonstrating energy storage and microgrid projects that utilize energy from renewable energy sources. A microgrid is a group of interconnected loads and distributed energy resources that acts as a single controllable entity and that can connect and disconnect from the electric grid to operate in grid-connected or island mode.</summary>
