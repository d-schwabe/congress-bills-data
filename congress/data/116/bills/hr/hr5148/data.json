Such policies and procedures shall include maintaining sufficient cash reserves to ensure the repayment of any required refunds, a plan to ensure custodial record-keeping of institutional records and student transcripts, and the maintenance of contact information to ensure direct communication between the state and each student in the event of an IHE closure."
