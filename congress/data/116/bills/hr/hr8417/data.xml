This bill allows participants in health savings accounts to pay for direct primary care service arrangements from such accounts. A direct primary care service arrangement is primary medical care provided by primary care practitioners if the sole compensation for such care is a fixed periodic fee.

The bill allows waivers to states under Medicaid to provide direct primary care to low-income Medicaid recipients.

The bill also allows health care facilities to participate in the National Health Service Corps Scholarship or Loan Repayment Program if they offer direct primary care service arrangements and are in a health professional shortage area.</summary>
