    "text": "Making Opportunities a Reality for Entrepreneurs Paycheck Protection Program or the More PPP Act\n\nThis bill provides additional funding for and modifies the Paycheck Protection Program established to support small businesses in response to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019).\n\nSpecifically, the bill increases funding for paycheck protection loans by $560 billion, and it provides additional funding of $571 billion for paycheck protection loans through FY2021. Further, the bill sets aside $200 billion for paycheck protection loans to businesses and nonprofit organizations with 25 or fewer employees, sole proprietors, independent contractors, and self-employed individuals.\n\nThe bill also modifies eligibility for the program by (1) making publicly traded companies ineligible to participate, and (2) requiring borrowers to certify a decline in revenue of 20% or more. Further, the bill makes it unlawful for a lender to discriminate against or give preferential treatment to any eligible recipient.\n\nThe Small Business Administration must report on the demographic data, including race, gender, and ethnicity, of paycheck protection loan recipients."
