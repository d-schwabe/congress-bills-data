Among other things, the bill

 directs the Department of Transportation to develop a training program for FAA employees who provide guidance and training to entities that certify a small business as a small business concern owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals; revises application requirements for certain airports to impose passenger facility charges, including by requiring such airports to include a detailed description of good faith efforts to contract with disadvantaged businesses; and requires certain airports to report annually on the number of new disadvantaged businesses that were awarded a contract or concession during the previous fiscal year.</summary>
