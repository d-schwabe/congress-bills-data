This bill authorizes the Joint Committee on Judicial Administration in the District of Columbia to establish a voluntary separation incentive payments program for nonjudicial employees of the District's courts substantially similar to that for certain federal employees and members of the uniformed services, except that the maximum payment amount to any individual may not exceed $25,000.

Additionally, the District's Public Defender Service may establish such a program for its employees, again limiting the maximum payment amount to any individual to $25,000.</summary>
