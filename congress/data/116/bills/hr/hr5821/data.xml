This bill establishes survey requirements for, and enforcement mechanisms against, certified hospice programs under Medicare.

Specifically, certified programs must undergo periodic surveys by a state, local, or approved accreditation agency, as specified; the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) must provide appropriate training for surveyors and publish information relating to survey results on its website. The CMS must also (1) conduct more frequent surveys of programs that are found to be noncompliant with applicable standards; and (2) take specified enforcement actions against such programs, based on the severity of the deficiencies. Enforcement actions include civil penalties, suspended Medicare payments, and termination of program certification.</summary>
