Sustainable chemistry, also known as green chemistry, is focused on conserving resources and minimizing the generation and use of hazardous substances in chemical processes.\n\n(Sec. 4) The entity shall develop a working framework of attributes characterizing and metrics for assessing sustainable chemistry.\n\nThe entity shall report to Congress and the Government Accountability Office on the present state and future of sustainable chemistry.\n\n(Sec. 5) The agencies participating in the entity shall carry out activities in support of sustainable chemistry, including activities that incorporate sustainable chemistry into existing research, development, demonstration, technology transfer, commercialization, education, and training programs. Any financial support provided shall (1) be available for pre-competitive activities only; and (2) not be used to promote the sale of a specific product, process, or technology, or to disparage a specific product, process, or technology.\n\nFor FY2021-FY2030, no later than 90 days after submission of the President's annual budget request, the entity shall prepare and submit to Congress a report that includes a summarized agency budget in support of the activities carried out under this bill. (Sec. 6) The agencies participating in the entity may facilitate and support, through financial, technical, or other assistance, the creation of partnerships between institutions of higher education, nongovernmental organizations, consortia, or companies across the value chain in the chemical industry, including small- and medium-sized enterprises.\n\nTo be eligible for support, a partnership in sustainable chemistry shall include at least one private sector organization.\n\nIn selecting partnerships for support, the agencies participating in the entity shall also consider the extent to which the applicants are willing and able to demonstrate evidence of support for, and commitment to, the entity's goals.\n\nFinancial support provided to partnerships may not be used to (1) support or expand a regulatory chemical management program at an implementing agency under a state law; (2) construct or renovate a building or structure; or (3) promote the sale of a specific product, process, or technology, or disparage a specific product, process, or technology."
