  <summary date="2020-10-06T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Fair Medical Debt Reporting Act 

This bill prohibits credit reporting agencies from including certain medical debt on a consumer report. Specifically, agencies may not include on a report medical debt that has not been placed for collection, medical debt that was placed for collection within a year prior to the report, or medical debt fully paid or settled within a certain period of time.

Before a person provides information regarding a consumer's medical debt to a credit reporting agency, that person must notify the consumer of the restrictions regarding the reporting of medical debt and provide the consumer with details regarding the medical debt.</summary>
