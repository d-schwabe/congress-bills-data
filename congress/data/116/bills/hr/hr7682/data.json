    "text": "Sudan Democratic Transition, Accountability, and Fiscal Transparency Act of 2020\n\nThis bill requires the Department of State to submit a strategy outlining U.S. support for a transition to civilian-led government in Sudan, and it authorizes certain measures to support and assist such a political transition.\n\nSpecifically, the bill requires the State Department to submit a strategy that includes (1) an articulation of specific U.S. objectives for the political transition in Sudan and a plan to achieve such objectives; (2) an assessment of reforms necessary to promote human rights, essential freedoms, and accountability, as well as a description of efforts to address such reforms; and (3) an assessment of security sector reforms by the Sudanese government, such as demobilizing militias and fostering civilian control of the armed forces.\n\nThe bill also authorizes the President to provide certain support for (1) democratic governance, rule of law, human rights, and fundamental freedoms; (2) programs to advance economic growth, private-sector productivity, and market-based solutions to development challenges; (3) conflict mitigation strategies to support long-term peace, stability and oversight of Sudanese security and intelligence services; and (4) accountability for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide.\n\nThe President must impose sanctions on individuals who the President determines are committing human rights abuses, exploiting natural resources, or undermining the political transition in Sudan.\n\nUpon certification that Sudan has taken steps to improve fiscal transparency, the Department of the Treasury and the State Department must engage with international financial institutions to restructure, reschedule, or cancel the sovereign debt of Sudan. During the transitional period in Sudan, Treasury may also support the use of certain funds to respond to the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) outbreak in Sudan."
