In carrying out the pilot program, DOT must provide that an originating state may transfer or sell to a recipient state a credit not previously used by the originating state. DOT must also make available a public website on which originating states must post the amount of toll credits that are available for sale or transfer to a recipient state.\n\nDOT may terminate the pilot program or the participation of any state in the pilot program if the program is not serving a public benefit or it is not cost effective."
