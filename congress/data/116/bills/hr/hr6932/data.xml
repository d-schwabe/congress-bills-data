  <summary date="2020-05-19T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill directs the Department of Defense (DOD) to phase in zero-emission non-tactical vehicles and reduce the petroleum consumption of the DOD federal fleet.

DOD must replace non-tactical vehicles ending their service lives with vehicles that are zero-emission. DOD must report on the feasibility of this requirement and may request an exception.

DOD must endeavor to reduce by October 1, 2030, its federal fleet annual petroleum consumption by 50% compared to FY2005 levels. If DOD cannot meet this goal, it must report on technical and practical constraints.</summary>
