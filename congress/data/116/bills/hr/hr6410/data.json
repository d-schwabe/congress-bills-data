(That act confers upon the President a broad set of authorities to influence domestic industry in order to provide essential materials and goods needed for the national defense.)\n\nThe President must (1) make a determination that the ventilators and protective equipment are essential for the national defense; (2) identify private-sector capacity to\u00a0produce such equipment; and (3) exercise authorities under the act to\u00a0mitigate, where possible, the dependency of the United States on overseas sources and to\u00a0ensure the supply of such equipment.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 public health emergency, the agency coordinating the response shall submit weekly reports to Congress on the status and distribution of such equipment."
