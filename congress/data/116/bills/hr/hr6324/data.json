    "text": "Too Small to Fail Act\n\nThis bill establishes requirements for, and revises components of, loan programs of the Small Business Administration (SBA) to provide economic relief to small businesses affected by COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019).\n\nSpecifically, the SBA must waive the requirement that small businesses affected by COVID-19 be unable to find credit elsewhere in order to be eligible for SBA loans, and it must provide loans made in response to COVID-19 at no interest rate. In addition, the SBA is authorized to temporarily defer payments on any SBA loan for a small business that is affected by COVID-19.\n\nDuring the period from January 31, 2020, and ending on December 31, 2020, eligible small businesses that apply for an emergency disaster loan in response to COVID-19 may request that the SBA provide an advance of up to $15,000 within three days of receiving the application. Such advance may be used for any allowable purpose, including (1) providing paid sick leave to employees who are unable to work due to direct effects of\u00a0 COVID-19, (2) maintaining payroll to retain employees during business disruptions or substantial shutdowns, and (3) making rent or mortgage payments. Applicants shall not be required to repay any amounts of such advance, even if they are subsequently denied an emergency disaster loan. Further, under certain conditions, such advance may also be taken into consideration when determining forgiveness for a loan to meet payroll costs."
