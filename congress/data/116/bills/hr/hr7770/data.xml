  <summary date="2020-07-24T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Fallen Pandemic Heroes Flag Act of 2020

This bill authorizes a Member of Congress to give a flag flown from the Capitol and a signed certificate containing an expression of sympathy to the immediate family of a frontline worker (a worker whose occupation presents an increased risk of exposure) who died in responding to the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic.

The Architect of the Capitol must issue regulations to accomplish this, including by identifying other workers who qualify as frontline workers and by establishing procedures for requesting a flag flown from the Capitol.</summary>
