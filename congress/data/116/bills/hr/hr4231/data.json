    "text": "Credit Access and Inclusion Act of 2019\n\nThis bill allows for the reporting of certain positive consumer-credit information to consumer reporting agencies. Specifically, a person or the Department of Housing and Urban Development may report information related to\u00a0a consumer's performance\u00a0in making payments either under a lease agreement for a dwelling or pursuant to a contract for a utility or telecommunications service. However, information about a consumer's usage of any utility or telecommunications service may be reported only to the extent that the information relates to payment by the consumer for such service or other terms of the provision of that service. Furthermore, an energy-utility firm may not report a consumer's outstanding balance as late if the firm and the consumer have entered into a payment plan and the consumer is meeting the obligations of that plan.\n\nSpecified provisions that\u00a0establish\u00a0civil liability\u00a0with respect to\u00a0furnishers of information to consumer reporting agencies shall not apply to any violation of the bill.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must report on the consumer impact of such reporting."
