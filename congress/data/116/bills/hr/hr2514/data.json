The bill also increases penalties for violations of anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism-financing laws, requires antiquities dealers to comply with these laws, and requires the reporting of beneficial ownership information to FinCEN in certain commercial real estate transactions.\n\nEvery five years, Treasury must update the threshold amounts for currency transaction reports to reflect inflation."
