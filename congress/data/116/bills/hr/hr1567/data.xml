This bill authorizes military departments to provide water for agricultural purposes in areas in which activities on a military installation have contaminated a water source with perfluoroalkyl or polyfluoroalkyl substances, such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) or perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS). The military departments may provide uncontaminated water or provide treatment for contaminated water. The agricultural products produced must be destined for human consumption.

The Department of the Air Force may acquire certain real property adjacent to an Air Force base that has shown signs of contamination from PFOA and PFOS due to activities on the base.

The Department of Defense must submit to Congress a remediation plan for water at or adjacent to a military base that is contaminated with PFOA or PFOS.</summary>
