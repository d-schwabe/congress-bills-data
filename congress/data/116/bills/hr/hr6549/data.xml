  <summary date="2020-04-17T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Business Borrowers Protection Act

This bill prohibits a lender from requiring a borrower to repay on an accelerated basis any loan received under a governmental program responding to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019). Further, a lender may not consider such a loan for purposes of determining whether the lender has the right to accelerate the due date of any loan agreement.

In addition, until two years after the termination of the COVID-19 national emergency, the bill (1) declares it to be U.S. policy that lenders should not accelerate due dates for any business loans or curtail any lines of credit, and (2) releases from liability a trustee that&#160;decides not to enforce a loan covenant that accelerates repayment under a loan agreement or reduces the availability of funds under a line of credit.</summary>
