This preemption ends three years after enactment.\n\nThe bill also\u00a0broadens the existing Securities and Exchange Commission registration exemption for the issuance of securities as part of an employee-compensation package. Specifically, the bill applies this exemption to the issuance of securities\u00a0as compensation for\u00a0independent contractors.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must report on the\u00a0bill's effects.\u00a0"
