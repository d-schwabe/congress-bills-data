This bill directs the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to parole into the United States an alien who is the spouse, widow or widower, parent, or child of a qualifying current or former member of the Armed Forces. A qualifying member of the Armed Forces shall be (1) a member of the Armed Forces on active duty, (2) a member of the Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve, or (3) a living or deceased individual who served in and was discharged from either service under a condition other than dishonorable.

Such parole may be denied only if DHS, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Veterans Affairs jointly issue a detailed written justification for the denial.</summary>
