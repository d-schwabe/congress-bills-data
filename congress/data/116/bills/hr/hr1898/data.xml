  <summary date="2019-03-27T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Cuba Agricultural Exports Act

This bill exempts from prohibitions against U.S. assistance to Cuba (1) any exports under the market access program, the export credit guarantee program, or&#160;the foreign market development cooperator program; and&#160;(2) any obligation or expenditure of funds to promote trade with Cuba by federal commodity promotion programs established in accordance with a commodity promotion law.

This exemption shall not apply if the U.S. assistance recipient would be an entity controlled by the Cuban government, including the armed forces or the Ministry of the Interior.

A person subject to U.S. jurisdiction may invest in the development of an agricultural business in Cuba if the Department of State and the Department of Agriculture jointly determine that the agricultural business

 is not controlled by the government of Cuba, including the armed forces or the Ministry of the Interior; and does not traffic in property of persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction that was confiscated by Cuba on or after January 1, 1959. A person subject to U.S. jurisdiction may provide payment or financing for agricultural sales to Cuba or to an individual or entity in Cuba.</summary>
