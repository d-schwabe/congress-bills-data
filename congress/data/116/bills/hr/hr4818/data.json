The State Department shall impose property- and visa-blocking sanctions on (1) the identified foreign individuals and entities, and (2) each corporate officer and principal shareholder with a controlling interest in the identified vessels.\n\nThe President may impose various sanctions on foreign individuals and entities that knowingly provide underwriting, insurance, or reinsurance for the identified vessels. The sanctions may include prohibitions from (1) receiving Export-Import Bank export assistance, (2) being designated as a primary dealer of U.S. government debt instruments, or\u00a0(3) receiving U.S. government procurement contracts.\n\nThe State Department shall develop a strategy on improving the energy security of U.S. allies in Europe. The State Department shall also report to Congress (1) on the effects of Russia's Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline on U.S. national security; and (2) a periodically updated list of entities providing goods, services, or technology for the construction or repair of the pipeline and whether such transactions are prohibited under certain U.S. laws."
