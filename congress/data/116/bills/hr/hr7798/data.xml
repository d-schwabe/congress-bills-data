This bill authorizes members of the Foreign Service or the Senior Foreign Service to submit a gap memo in advance of having their performance evaluated by a selection board, and it prohibits members of a selection board from considering such a submission as negative when evaluating a member's performance.

A gap memo is a written record indicating and explaining a gap in the record of a member that is due to personal circumstances, including for health, family, or other reasons.</summary>
