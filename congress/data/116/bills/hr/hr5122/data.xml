This bill imposes additional requirements related to the public database of registrations that are filed, as required by the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA),&#160;by agents that&#160;engage in certain political activities for foreign principals. Specifically, the Department of Justice shall establish the National Foreign Agents Database, which shall be a publicly searchable, sortable, and machine-processable database of the information contained in such registrations.&#160;Current law&#160;requires a database of registrations to have search and sort functions only to the extent technically practicable.

FARA-required registrations shall be filed in an electronic, structured data format. Electronically filed registrations shall be immediately available to the public over the internet.</summary>
