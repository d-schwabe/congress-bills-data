This bill directs the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to award grants to certain entities, including states, local governments, and nonprofit organizations, to carry out projects that further agricultural resiliency and modernization, such as projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions; improve air, water, and soil health; and increase carbon sequestration.

Additionally, USDA must establish a program to award grants to governmental organizations and private entities in the agricultural sector to carry out at least 10 pilot projects with the potential to reduce or sequester greenhouse emissions that convert and valorize tree nut harvest by-products and waste into multiple higher value biocarbon products, including sustainable industrial applications, agrochemicals, repurposing process heat, energy, and construction materials.</summary>
