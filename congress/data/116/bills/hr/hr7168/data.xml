  <summary date="2020-06-11T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Creating Capacity for Communities in Need Act

This bill provides for an exception, during the national emergency relating to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019), to provisions under the Stark law (i.e., the Physician Self-Referral Law) that prohibit physician-owned hospitals from expanding facility capacity.

Specifically, the bill excludes from such restrictions any increase in operating rooms, procedure rooms, or beds for which a hospital is licensed or begins construction during the period of March 13, 2020, through the last day of the national emergency.</summary>
