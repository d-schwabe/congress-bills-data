This bill directs the Agricultural Marketing Service of the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to provide competitive grants to agricultural producers and other agricultural entities to support worker and public health and safety, or to adapt production, processing, distribution, and sales systems, in response to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019).

In awarding grants, preference shall be given to applications containing proposals intended to (1) expand access to food for participants in USDA food and nutrition programs; (2) enhance food distribution in high-need or underserved areas; (3) address local agricultural product oversupply issues and reduce food waste; or (4) benefit young, beginning, or socially disadvantaged farmers or ranchers.

The amount of a grant shall not exceed $15,000 for individual agricultural producers and $35,000 for other agricultural entities.

USDA must conduct outreach to states and eligible entities with respect to the availability of grants under the bill.</summary>
