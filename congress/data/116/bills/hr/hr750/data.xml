This bill requires that excepted federal and District of Columbia public employees required to perform work during certain lapses in appropriations (i.e., government shutdowns) be paid, at their standard rate of pay, on scheduled pay dates.

Under current law, such employees must be paid at the earliest possible date after the lapse in appropriations ends.</summary>
