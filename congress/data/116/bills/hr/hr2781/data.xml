  <summary date="2019-10-28T12:48:37Z" status="Passed House">Educating Medical Professionals and Optimizing Workforce Efficiency and Readiness for Health Act of 2019 or the EMPOWER for Health Act of 2019 This bill reauthorizes through FY2024 certain Health Resources &amp; Services Administration (HRSA) training and education grants programs for health care professionals, including, among others, funding to increase the number of health care professionals from underrepresented groups. The bill also revises and reauthorizes through FY2024 the HRSA Geriatrics Workforce Enhancement Program and the Geriatrics Academic Career Award Program. Grants under these programs may be used to (1) support clinical training and integrate health care services for older adults and (2) promote the career development of eligible faculty specializing in geriatric health. HRSA must prioritize the funding of training and services in rural and underserved areas. Further, the bill reauthorizes the pediatric specialty loan repayment program. The program provides qualified pediatric medical specialists or child and adolescent mental, behavioral, and psychiatric health specialists up to three years of loan repayment in exchange for two years of service providing health care in an area with limited access to such care.

Finally, the bill establishes grants for education programs to provide scholarships or stipends to students from underrepresented groups who are enrolled in programs for physical or occupational therapy, audiology, or speech-language pathology.</summary>
