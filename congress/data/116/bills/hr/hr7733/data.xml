This bill authorizes the President to impose property- and visa-blocking sanctions on foreign individuals and entities involved in deliberate acts to conceal or distort information about a public health emergency of international concern, including COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019).

Specifically, the President may impose sanctions on (1) a government official (or a senior associate of such an official) who is responsible for or complicit in deliberate acts to conceal or distort information about an international public health emergency, or who financially benefits from such acts; or (2) a foreign person or entity that has materially assisted or supported such acts.</summary>
