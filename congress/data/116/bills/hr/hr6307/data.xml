This bill requires a federal agency to provide a small business contractor with additional time to perform its responsibilities and to pay such contractor regardless of any delay or interruption that is due to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019).

Specifically, a small business that is party to a contract with a federal agency and which experiences an adverse impact to its operations as a result of COVID-19 shall be provided with 90 additional days, or such additional time as deemed appropriate, to carry out its responsibilities under the contract.

Further, if such performance of a federal goods or services contract is unavoidably delayed or interrupted by the inability of the small business's employees to access government facilities or resources due to restrictions related to COVID-19, the government shall pay the entity, upon submission of required documentation, the prices stipulated in the contract for goods or services as if performance had been rendered.</summary>
