  <summary date="2020-09-16T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill bars amounts from the Land and Water Conservation Fund from being used by the Department of the Interior or the Department of Agriculture to acquire private land within a county in which 50% or more of the land is owned by the federal government, unless the department acquiring the private land disposes of an equal amount of federally owned land within that county during the same fiscal year to ensure no net loss of private, taxable acreage in that county.</summary>
