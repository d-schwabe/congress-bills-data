The office must perform the cost-benefit analyses of proposed CFTC regulations and orders. Additionally, such cost-benefit analyses must consider, among other things, the impact of market liquidity on relevant markets, available alternatives to direct regulation, and the cost of compliance for all regulated entities.\n\nA court must affirm such cost-benefit analyses, unless it finds an abuse of discretion."
