  <summary date="2020-03-19T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Coronavirus Relief for Seniors and People with Disabilities Act of 2020

This bill provides funding and establishes additional programs under Medicare and Medicaid to address the public health emergency declared on January 31, 2020, relating to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019).

Specifically, the bill provides FY2020 supplemental appropriations to the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services for specified quality improvement and laboratory certification activities. The funds are designated as an emergency requirement, which exempts the funds from discretionary spending limits and other budget enforcement rules.

In addition, the bill (1) temporarily requires state Medicaid programs to provide Medicare cost-sharing assistance to certain individuals who qualify for, or are enrolled in, the low-income subsidy program under the Medicare prescription drug benefit; and (2) authorizes a grant program to support Medicaid home- and community-based services during the public health emergency.</summary>
