Non-federally owned land and water may not be designated as critical habitat without the written consent of the property owners unless a threatened or endangered species is at risk of extinction without such a designation.\n\nThe department concerned must pay an owner or lessee 150% of the fair market value of real property and is responsible for all related costs.\n\nInterior shall issue a final rule that requires the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to follow rules substantially similar to the requirements for the U.S. Geological Survey to obtain permission for certain access to private lands.\n\nFurthermore, it shall not be a violation of law to take any animal if it poses a recurring threat to life and property."
