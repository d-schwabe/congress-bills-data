This bill sets forth requirements for a change in airport sponsorship or operations with respect to airport operating certificates.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) must issue an airport operating certificate to a new sponsor or operator if (1) the holder of the airport operating certificate for such airport consents to the transfer of sponsorship or operations, and (2) the new sponsor or operator satisfies all requirements for obtaining a certificate.

If the holder of the airport operating certificate disputes the transfer, the FAA must issue a certificate to the new sponsor if all requirements are satisfied and the dispute is resolved through legal action, including the issuance of a final, non-appealable judicial decision requiring a change of sponsorship or operations.</summary>
