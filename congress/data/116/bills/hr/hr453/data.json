Additionally, the TVA must be compensated for lost hydropower capacity from future development of these lands.\n\nThe bill prohibits the United States from being liable for loss or damage resulting from certain activities, such as the flooding of certain lands.\n\nThe bill outlines TVA's continuing responsibilities, including those related to environmental remediation.\n\nGaming on these lands is prohibited."
