The President may approve such a purchase only if, among other things, the purchase price was not significantly affected by the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic and the sale will not permit additional access to distribute propaganda or alter U.S. news and media consumption.\n\nThe bill's provisions cease to have force or effect once the United States has substantially recovered from the economic impacts of the pandemic."
