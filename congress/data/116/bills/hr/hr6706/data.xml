  <summary date="2020-05-05T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill requires the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to review any purchase by a Chinese entity of a controlling interest in a U.S. company deemed critical to national security, critical infrastructure, or of cultural significance. The President may approve such a purchase only if, among other things, the purchase price was not significantly affected by the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic and the sale will not permit additional access to distribute propaganda or alter U.S. news and media consumption.

The bill's provisions cease to have force or effect once the United States has substantially recovered from the economic impacts of the pandemic.</summary>
