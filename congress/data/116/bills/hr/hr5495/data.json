    "text": "Federal Electronic Equipment Donation Act of 2019\n\nThis bill directs federal agencies to transfer excess federal electronic equipment, including computers and related peripheral tools, to educational recipients.\n\nEach agency shall identify useful electronic equipment determined to be excess to the needs of the agency (excluding research equipment) and\n\n report such equipment to the General Services Administration (GSA) for processing for transfer to an educational recipient; transfer such equipment directly to an educational recipient, through an arrangement made by the GSA; or report such equipment to the GSA as excess property if such transfers are not practicable. Each agency shall report to the GSA the availability of useful federal electronic equipment as far as possible in advance. If the equipment is not classroom-usable, the transferring agency shall convey the equipment initially to a nonprofit refurbisher for upgrade before transfer.\n\nThe transferring agency shall (1) remove data using a means that does not render the equipment or components unusable, and (2) give the highest preference to educational recipients located in a persistent poverty county or other specified areas.\n\nA state's plan for distributing donated federal equipment must give the highest preference for electronic equipment to institutions that are located in an enterprise community, an empowerment zone, or specified high poverty areas."
