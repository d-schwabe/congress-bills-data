  <summary date="2019-03-04T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Facilitating Innovation and New Technology so Entrepreneurs Create and Hire Act of 2019 or the FINTECH Act of 2019 

This bill addresses the regulation of financial technology (fintech) start-ups. The FinTech Council is established within the Department of the Treasury. The council must designate, upon request by a fintech start-up, which federal financial regulators have exclusive oversight authority over that start-up. This designation lasts for two years and in general provides a safe harbor from enforcement actions by other regulators. To be eligible, a fintech start-up must meet certain requirements, including by demonstrating that they offer a financial innovation that serves the public interest.

In each federal financial regulatory agency there is established an Office of Financial Innovation. Duties of the office include coordinating agency efforts to reduce regulatory burdens on eligible start-ups and conducting outreach to a start-up in the event of a regulatory action.

The Advisory Council of FinTech Directors is established to provide advice to each federal financial regulator regarding the supervision of eligible fintech start-ups.</summary>
