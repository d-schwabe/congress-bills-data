  <summary date="2020-04-03T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill authorizes the President to temporarily suspend activities relating to the 2020 decennial census of population.

Specifically, the President may suspend census activities, including in-person interviews and reporting deadlines, until the earlier of the date on which

 the President determines that the threat of COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) has subsided such that a suspension is no longer necessary; or the national emergency declared on March 13, 2020, relating to COVID-19 is terminated.</summary>
