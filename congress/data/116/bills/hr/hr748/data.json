    "text": "Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act or the CARES Act \n\nThis bill responds to the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) outbreak and its impact on the economy, public health, state and local governments, individuals, and businesses.\n\nDIVISION A--KEEPING WORKERS PAID AND EMPLOYED, HEALTH CARE SYSTEM ENHANCEMENTS, AND ECONOMIC STABILIZATION\n\nThis division establishes the Paycheck Protection Program to provide eight weeks of cash flow assistance to small businesses through federally guaranteed loans to employers who maintain their payroll. Such assistance shall be to cover costs such as payroll, paid sick leave, supply chain disruptions, and employee salaries. The division further provides that certain amounts owed on such loans are eligible to be forgiven.\n\nThe division also authorizes the Small Business Administration (SBA) to provide advances on SBA emergency disaster loans for small businesses that have applied for such loans due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAdditionally, the division requires the SBA to pay all principal, interest, and fees on certain new and existing SBA loans for a period of six months.\n\nTITLE I--KEEPING AMERICAN WORKERS PAID AND EMPLOYED ACT\n\nThis title provides emergency economic relief for small businesses to meet their payroll and expenses and to receive education and assistance throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n(Sec. 1102) This section authorizes the Small Business Administration (SBA) to guarantee paycheck protection loans during the period beginning on February 15, 2020, and ending on June 30, 2020.\n\nDuring this period, in addition to a small business, any business, nonprofit organization, veterans organization, or tribal business is eligible to receive a paycheck protection loan if it employs fewer than 500 employees or the applicable SBA size standard for the relevant industry. In addition, individuals who operate as sole proprietors or as independent contractors, as well as certain self-employed individuals, are eligible to receive a paycheck protection loan.\n\nAllowable uses for such loans include (1) payroll costs, (2) continuation of group health care benefits, (3) employee salaries, and (4) rent payments.\n\n(Sec. 1103) This section authorizes the SBA to award grants to resource partners to provide specified education, training, and advising to small business concerns that are negatively impacted as a result of COVID-19.\n\n(Sec. 1104) This section requires the SBA to reimburse any recipient of a grant under the State Trade Expansion Program for financial losses relating to a foreign trade mission or a trade show exhibition that was cancelled solely due to a public health emergency related to COVID-19. Such reimbursement may not exceed the recipient's grant funding.\n\n(Sec. 1105) This section temporarily waives the requirement that participants in the Women's Business Center Program of the SBA obtain matching cash contributions from non-federal sources as a requirement for participation in the program.\n\n(Sec. 1106) This section makes recipients of paycheck protection loans eligible for forgiveness of amounts expended for payroll costs and payments of interest on mortgage obligations, rent, or utilities during the eight-week period such loans are provided.\n\n(Sec. 1107) This section provides specified appropriations for\n\n paycheck protection loans, salaries and expenses of the SBA, necessary expenses of the Office of Inspector General of the SBA, awarding of grants for entrepreneurial development, provision of technical assistance to minority business centers by the Minority Business Development Agency, disbursement of advances on emergency disaster loans, SBA subsidies for certain loan payments, and the Department of the Treasury to enable certain financial institutions to participate in the paycheck protection program.

(Sec. 3202) This section specifies the process for private health insurance plan issuers to reimburse providers of COVID-19 diagnostic tests. Specifically, a reimbursement rate negotiated for such test prior to the public health emergency declared on January 31, 2020, continues to apply for the duration of the emergency. If a reimbursement rate was not negotiated prior to the emergency declaration, an issuer may either negotiate such rate or pay the provider's cash price.\n\nAdditionally, test providers must publish the cash price of tests on their websites; HHS may assess a civil penalty for violations of this requirement.\n\n(Sec. 3203) This section shortens the time frame under which private health-insurance plans must cover certain new preventative services related to COVID-19.

Specifically, it creates an FDA administrative order process for the evaluation of OTC products, replacing the present notice and comment rulemaking approach. Under the new process, the FDA may issue an administrative order determining a specific OTC drug, class of drugs, or combination is generally regarded as safe and effective and not subject to the new drug application process.

For drugs determined to be generally regarded as safe and effective pursuant to an administrative order requested by a sponsor (rather than initiated by the FDA), the requestor is granted 18 months of market exclusivity.

Any guarantee must (1) be limited to the value of a shareholder's account in a money-market fund as of the close of business the day before the announcement of the guarantee, and (2) terminate no later than December 31, 2020.\n\nThe Exchange Stabilization Fund must be reimbursed, upon termination of this authority, to the extent that payments made exceed fees collected.\n\n(Sec. 4016) Certain membership, credit-extension, and borrowing restrictions regarding the National Credit Union Administration Central Liquidity Facility are temporarily waived.\n\n(Sec. 4017) This section temporarily waives requirements related to the President's authority to provide economic incentives for domestic industries that expand production of essential materials and goods needed for the national defense.
