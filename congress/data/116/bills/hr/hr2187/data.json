    "text": "Jobs Originated through Launching Travel Act of 2019 or the JOLT Act of 2019\n\nThis bill establishes a nonimmigrant visa for qualified Canadian citizens and makes various amendments related to nonimmigrant visas.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) may admit as a visitor a Canadian citizen who (1) is at least 50 years old, (2) maintains a residence in Canada, (3) owns a U.S. residence or has signed a rental agreement for the duration of the stay, (4) is not inadmissible or deportable under various provisions, (5) will not engage in U.S. employment, and (6) will not seek U.S. assistance or benefits. Such visitors may be admitted for up to 240 days out of any single 365-day period.\n\nThe Visa Waiver Program (program allowing citizens of participating countries to visit the United States without a visa) shall be renamed the Secure Travel Partnership Program. The bill amends various provisions relating to the program, such as the maximum nonimmigrant visa refusal rate a qualifying country may have. DHS may waive the refusal rate requirement if a country meets other requirements, such as entering into intelligence collection and information sharing arrangements with the United States.\n\nThe Department of State shall set a goal of interviewing nonimmigrant visa applicants worldwide within 15 days of receiving the application and periodically report to Congress on efforts to meet this goal. The State Department shall conduct a pilot program for using secure remote videoconferencing technology for conducting visa interviews for certain classes of nonimmigrant visa applications."
