(A remotely created check is a check not issued by the bank and not signed by the account owner.)\n\nA voluntary agreement to repay a small-dollar consumer credit transaction by an electronic fund transfer is subject to certain protections, including the right of the consumer to stop payment.\n\nSmall-dollar consumer credit providers must register with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Any small-dollar consumer credit transaction is subject to the laws of the state in which the consumer resides.\n\nThe bill also prohibits overdraft fees on prepaid accounts."
