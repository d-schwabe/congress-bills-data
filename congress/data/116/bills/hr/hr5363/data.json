The IRS must also establish and implement procedures for recertifying income for purposes of this bill and for requesting tax return information.\n\nThe bill requires ED and the IRS to issue joint reports to Congress on this bill, including an update on the status of implementation of this bill and an evaluation of how such implementation affected the processing of applications for financial aid and discharge of student loans."
