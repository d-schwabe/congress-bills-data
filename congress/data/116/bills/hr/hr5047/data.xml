This bill directs the General Services Administration (GSA) to annually complete an audit of active leases of space in federal buildings in which at least 20% of a building is leased to any entity pursuant to any provision of law.

Each audit must determine whether the federal government has received all rent, revenues, and anything of value due according to the provisions of each lease.

The GSA must report completed audits to Congress. Also, for any lease that becomes effective on or after the enactment of this bill, the GSA must require that the lease contain audit rights for the GSA and its Inspector General.</summary>
