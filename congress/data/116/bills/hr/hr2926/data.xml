This bill revises certain standards for shipping safety with respect to vessel operations.

Specifically, the bill

 requires certain vessels to be equipped with electronic navigational charts that meet standards acceptable to the U.S. Coast Guard; mandates buffers between traffic lanes and traffic separation schemes, and offshore structures affixed to the submerged lands of the Outer Continental Shelf; requires the Coast Guard to implement the recommendations of the Atlantic Coast Port Access Route Study workgroup; directs the Coast Guard to conduct a review of navigation on the U.S. east coast and submit recommendations for new fairways; authorizes the Coast Guard to establish a safety zone to address special activities in the U.S. exclusive economic zone; and allows towing vessels to transit beyond the boundary line in certain limited situations to fulfill the vessel's duties without being subject to additional requirements.</summary>
