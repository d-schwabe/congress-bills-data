Hospitals that comply with the reporting requirements receive increased Medicare payments until 2024. Beginning in 2025, hospitals that fail to report receive reduced Medicare payments.\n\nIn addition, the National Academy of Medicine must conduct a study and provide recommendations to mitigate the occurrence of ambulance diversions and improve the health and safety of patients affected by ambulance diversions."
