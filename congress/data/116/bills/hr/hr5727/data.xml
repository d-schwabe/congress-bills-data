This bill requires certain reporting and research activities related to ambulance diversions (i.e., temporary closures of a hospital emergency department to incoming ambulances).

Specifically, Medicare-participating&#160;hospitals that divert ambulances from their emergency departments must report to the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services on&#160;(1) the length of the diversion, (2) the reason for the diversion, and (3) the number of ambulance calls turned away while the diversion was in effect. Hospitals that comply with the reporting requirements receive increased Medicare payments until 2024. Beginning in 2025, hospitals that fail to report receive reduced Medicare payments.

In addition, the National Academy of Medicine must conduct a study and provide recommendations to mitigate the occurrence of ambulance diversions and improve the health and safety of patients affected by ambulance diversions.</summary>
