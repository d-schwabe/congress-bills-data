This bill generally restricts the use of a foreign public accounting firm by a foreign issuer of securities.

The bill requires certain disclosures from a foreign issuer of securities that uses, for its required audit report to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a foreign public accounting firm that is not subject to inspection by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.

If an issuer uses such a foreign public accounting firm, the issuer is generally prohibited from listing its securities on a national securities exchange. Specifically, an issuer that is not currently listed on an exchange and uses such a firm may not be listed. A currently-listed issuer will be delisted beginning in 2025 if the issuer uses such a firm for three consecutive years.</summary>
