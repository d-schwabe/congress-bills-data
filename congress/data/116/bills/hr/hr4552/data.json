Such provisional transportation security cards are for use beginning on the date a covered veteran applies for a transportation security card and ending on the date on which such card is issued or denied.\n\nA covered veteran is an individual who (1) served in the active military, naval, or air service, and who was discharged or released under honorable conditions; and (2) during such service was subjected to a rigorous security screening."
