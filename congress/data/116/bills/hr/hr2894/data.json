The bill increases the limit to $15,000 (twice the amount in the case of a joint return) and requires the new limit to be adjusted for inflation after 2019.\n\nThe bill also increases the income tax rate for corporations to an amount that the Department of the Treasury determines is required to cover the reduction in revenue resulting from the increased tax deduction\u00a0allowed by\u00a0this bill."
