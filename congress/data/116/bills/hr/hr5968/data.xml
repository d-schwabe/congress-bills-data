  <summary date="2020-02-25T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Community Solar Consumer Choice Act of 2020

This bill supports the expansion of community solar energy and doubles the allowable time period for a long-term contract between the General Services Administration (GSA) and a public utility.

Specifically, the bill requires the Department of Energy (DOE) to establish a program for expanding community solar energy options, including options for low-income and moderate-income individuals. In addition, DOE must expand existing grant, loan, and financing programs to include community solar projects as specified by the bill.

Further, the bill revises requirements for electric utilities, including by requiring each electric utility to offer a community solar program.

Finally, the bill allows the GSA to make a public utility contract for a period of up to 20 years. Currently, the GSA may make a public utility contract for up to 10 years.</summary>
