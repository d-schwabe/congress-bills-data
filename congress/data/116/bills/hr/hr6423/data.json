Among other things, debt collectors may not during this period\n\n charge fees or apply a higher interest rate as a result of nonpayment, commence or continue litigation to collect a debt, enforce a security interest through a repossession or foreclosure, report past due debt to a credit reporting agency, seize assets, or terminate utility service. The bill also prohibits during this period a confession of judgment or similar agreement as a condition to a loan or extension of credit. (A confession of judgment is an agreement to a judgment of liability without notice and opportunity to be heard in court in the event of the default of a borrower.)"
