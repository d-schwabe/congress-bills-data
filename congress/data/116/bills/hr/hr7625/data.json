    "text": "Ryan Frascone Memorial Student Loan Relief Act of 2020\n\nThis bill retroactively applies certain borrower protections related to cosigners of private student loans. Specifically, all private student loan agreements must (1) prohibit a creditor from declaring a default or accelerating the debt of a private student loan on the sole basis of the death or bankruptcy of a cosigner to such a loan, and (2) require loan holders to release cosigners from any obligation upon the death of the student borrower. Under current law, these protections apply only to private student loan agreements entered into on or after November 20, 2018."
