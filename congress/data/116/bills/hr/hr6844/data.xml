This bill addresses both employer liability relating to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) and unemployment benefits.

Specifically, employers are exempt from liability for any injury that results from an employee contracting COVID-19. However, this exemption does not apply if the employer violates state or federal workplace safety law.

Additionally, employees may still be eligible for unemployment benefits if the employee terminates their employment due to their employer failing to address their health concerns.</summary>
