  <summary date="2020-09-11T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Restoring Essential Service to Small Airports Act 

This bill directs the Department of Transportation to reinstitute a subsidy under the Essential Air Service program for all airports that were removed from such program after FY2015. The Essential Air Service program was established to ensure that small communities that were served by certificated air carriers before deregulation would continue to receive scheduled passenger service, with subsidies if necessary.</summary>
