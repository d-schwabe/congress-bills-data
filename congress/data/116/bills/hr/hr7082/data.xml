This bill directs the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to issue regulations with respect to protection against COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) for workers in meat processing establishments. Through the end of the COVID-19 emergency period, USDA must review and update such regulations at least every 90 days to ensure worker safety.

Until such regulations are issued, the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with respect to worker safety must be used as interim requirements for meat processing establishments.</summary>
