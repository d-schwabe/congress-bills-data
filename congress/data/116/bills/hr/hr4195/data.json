The bill retains a process for U.S. territories to apply for such assistance, but alters the\u00a0formula by\u00a0which the amount of assistance is calculated. Specifically, the bill phases in modifications to the formula that more closely align how assistance is calculated for U.S. territories with how it is calculated for the 50 states and the District of Columbia."
