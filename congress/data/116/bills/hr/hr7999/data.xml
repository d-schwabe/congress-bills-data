This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to address shortages of personal protective equipment and delays in testing for COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) that are reported by health care providers, public health agencies, or&#160;certain nursing facilities.

Specifically, HHS must implement a process to respond to these reports within 30 days and outline the actions being taken to resolve the shortages and delays. HHS must also provide&#160;its response to the congressional delegation that represents the district or districts from which the reports originated.</summary>
