This bill authorizes the Small Business Administration to guarantee up to 90% of the amount of a loan made to a small business that has 100 or fewer employees, has been in business for at least one year, and has obtained training from a small business development center. The loan guarantee must be used for the acquisition of cybersecurity technology and services and the cost of the installation or use of such technology and services.

For purposes of this bill, cybersecurity technology and services excludes information technology whose sole use is financial management, maintenance of inventory of basic supplies, or appointment scheduling.</summary>
