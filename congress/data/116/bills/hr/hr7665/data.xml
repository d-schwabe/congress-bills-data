  <summary date="2020-07-16T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill requires the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) to extend for at least one year the exclusion of certain Chinese goods from additional duties. Such goods include medical-care products needed to address the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic.

The USTR is not required to take such action if it determines that (1) a good is strategically important or related to certain Chinese industrial programs, and (2) such an extension would cause severe harm to the United States.</summary>
