This bill establishes a temporary grant program to assist schools with reopening and resuming instruction during the 2020-2021 school year in response to the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic.

Specifically, the Department of Education (ED) must award grants to states and, through them, subgrants to local educational agencies to reopen schools and resume instruction during the 2020-2021 school year. ED must also reserve funds for outlying areas and the Bureau of Indian Education.

Subgrants must be used for certain expenses, such as educational technology, facility sanitization, and staffing.</summary>
