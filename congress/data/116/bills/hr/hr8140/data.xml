This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to research adverse health impacts associated with violent interactions with law enforcement and carry out activities to promote access to, and awareness of, trauma support services and mental and behavioral health care among racial and ethnic minority groups.

Specifically, HHS must (1) award grants to community-based programs or organizations to increase access to appropriate services and care, and (2) conduct an educational campaign to raise awareness of mental and behavioral health issues and reduce stigma associated with such conditions.</summary>
