    "text": "This bill provides authority for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to carry out aquatic ecosystem restoration projects to improve habitat or passage for anadromous fish, including (1) installing fish bypass structures on small water diversions, (2) modifying tide gates, and (3) restoring or reconnecting floodplains and wetlands that are important for anadromous fish habitat or passage. Anadromous fish are species of fish that spawn in fresh or estuarine waters and that migrate to ocean waters.\n\nThe Corps must give such projects equal priority for implementation as other aquatic ecosystem restoration projects."
