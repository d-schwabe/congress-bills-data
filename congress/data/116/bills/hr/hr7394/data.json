Specifically, insurers qualify for the program if the insurer has at least one outstanding and existing policy for business interruption coverage that (1) expressly covers losses during a civil authority shutdown as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and (2) expressly excludes coverage for a virus. Participation in the program is voluntary."
