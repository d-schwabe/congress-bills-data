To obtain export privilege eligibility, the company shall also establish with the Department of the Treasury a $2.5 billion account to pay any patent infringement judgments against it.\n\nAn entity seeking a preliminary injunction against such a company in an infringement lawsuit shall not be required to establish that irreparable harm would result if the injunction is not granted."
