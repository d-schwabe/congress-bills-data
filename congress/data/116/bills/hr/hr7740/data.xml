This bill provides designated Small Business Administration (SBA) assistance for small businesses with 10 or fewer employees.

Specifically, out of the Paycheck Protection Program established to support small businesses in response to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019), the bill allots $20 billion of remaining program funds for small businesses with 10 or fewer employees.

Additionally, the bill raises the aggregate amount for SBA loans to such small businesses from $6 million to $10 million. The bill adds the expansion of such small businesses to the list of economic development objectives from which a small business development company must demonstrate at least one in order to qualify for SBA assistance. It also requires a participating small business development company to provide specified assistance to such small businesses.</summary>
