This bill directs the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the General Services Administration (GSA) to carry out specified reviews related to the ability of CISA to carry out its mission.

Specifically, CISA must undertake a review that includes an assessment of (1) how additional budget resources could be used for certain projects, (2) whether existing personnel are appropriately matched to the prioritization of threats in the cyber domain and risks to critical infrastructure, and (3) its facilities and their suitability to support current and projected mission requirements.

Additionally, the GSA must review CISA's assessment of its facilities and make recommendations regarding necessary resources for procuring or building new or augmented facilities.</summary>
