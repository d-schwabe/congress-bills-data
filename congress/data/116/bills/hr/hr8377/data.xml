 This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to increase the corporate income tax rate for publicly traded corporations that pay their chief executive officers or highest paid employees more than 100 times the median compensation of all their U.S. employees or that increase the number of contracted or foreign employees.

The bill also requires an executive agency, in the evaluation of bids or proposals for federal contracts, to give preference to a bidder that has a compensation ratio of highly paid to all employees of less than 50 to 1 in the previous calendar year.</summary>
