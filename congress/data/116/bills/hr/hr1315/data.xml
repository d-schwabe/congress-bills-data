This bill reauthorizes and modifies the Department of Energy's Office of Minority Economic Impact.

The bill (1) renames the office as the Office of Economic Impact, Diversity, and Employment; and (2) directs the office to establish a comprehensive program to improve education and training for jobs in energy-related industries, with emphasis on increasing the number of skilled individuals from underrepresented groups trained to work in those jobs.

The office must provide grants to certain businesses to pay the wages of employees when they are receiving training for jobs in the renewable energy, energy efficiency, or grid modernization sectors.</summary>
