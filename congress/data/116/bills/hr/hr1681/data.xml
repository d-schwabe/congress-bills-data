This bill requires states to impose the same requirements for appearing on the ballot in a general congressional election on all candidates, without regard to whether a candidate is the nominee of a political party.

In such elections, states must use a ballot that requires a specific vote for a candidate and that does not permit the casting of a single vote for all candidates of the same political party.</summary>
