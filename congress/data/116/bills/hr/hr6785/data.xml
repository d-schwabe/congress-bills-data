This bill requires the President to appoint a tribal response coordinating officer immediately following the declaration of a multi-state major disaster or emergency.

The duties of such officer shall include

 conducting an assessment of relief most urgently needed in consultation with all affected Indian tribal governments; in the case of a public health emergency, working with the Indian Health Service to conduct outreach to tribally operated health programs to assess needs; establishing a liaison within each Bureau of Indian Affairs Regional Office and each Indian Health Service Area Office; coordinating administration of relief to Indian tribal governments and tribal healthcare providers (including, in the event of a public health emergency, distributions from the Strategic National Stockpile, and establishing a single point of contact for tribal requests for assistance); and coordinating assistance with submission of reimbursement requests and grant applications. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) shall consider a request from an Indian tribal government in the same manner as a request from a state.</summary>
