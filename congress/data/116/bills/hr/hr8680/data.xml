This bill establishes immunity from antitrust liability for an official action taken by an occupational licensing board, or any member, officer, employee, or agent of the board, as long as specified requirements are met.

These requirements include that the board be established in a state where (1) all members of the board must be appointed or assigned by the chief executive officer, the legislature, or other elected officer of the state; (2) the board must include public representation; and (3) there is required to be a mechanism in effect under which a person aggrieved by an action of the board has the right to contest the action, review all evidence, receive a final decision in writing, and appeal an adverse decision to an independent adjudicator.</summary>
