  <summary date="2019-10-08T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Star Rating for Biosimilars Act

This bill requires the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) to establish quality measures regarding biosimilar biological products under the five-star performance rating system for Medicare Advantage plans. The measures must assess the level of access that plans provide to covered biosimilars, including with respect to formularies, cost-sharing, and utilization management.

The CMS must also incorporate such measures into similar rating systems for plans under the Medicare prescription drug benefit.</summary>
