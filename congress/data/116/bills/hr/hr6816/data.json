The bill also extends by one month the deadline for a small business to rehire employees or eliminate salary or wage reductions to be eligible for loan forgiveness.\n\nThe bill authorizes the Small Business Administration, after considering specified criteria, to further extend the deadline for rehiring employees or eliminating salary or wage reductions for entities within certain industry categories."
