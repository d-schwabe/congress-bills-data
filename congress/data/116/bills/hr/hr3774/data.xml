  <summary date="2019-07-16T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer Improvements Act of 2019

This bill modifies the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs administered by the Small Business Administration (SBA).

Specifically, the bill

 requires the Department of Defense to report on the goals and incentives used to increase awards of SBIR and STTR contracts; prioritizes innovation in manufacturing and cybersecurity; directs federal agencies to issue Phase III awards to technology developers without requiring further competition; requires agencies' senior procurement executives to coordinate with SBIR and STTR program officers to assist small businesses; requires the SBA to conduct outreach efforts at minority institutions and Hispanic-serving institutions; makes permanent (as the Civilian Agency Commercialization Readiness Program) the pilot program that a covered agency may establish for awarding SBIR and STTR Phase II and III funds for technology development and progression toward commercialization; requires all agencies participating in the SBIR program to establish a Commercialization Assistance Pilot Program to make SBIR Phase II awards to commercialize a project undertaken by a small business with SBIR Phase I awards; authorizes specified agencies to use a percentage of STTR funds for a Proof of Concept Partnership pilot program to accelerate the creation of small businesses and the commercialization of research innovations; and authorizes all agencies participating in the SBIR program, during FY2020-FY2024, to provide a SBIR Phase II award for a project to a small business concern without regard to whether such concern was provided a Phase I award for such project.</summary>
