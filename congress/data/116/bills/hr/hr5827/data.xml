  <summary date="2020-02-10T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Trusted Traveler REAL ID Relief Act of 2020

This bill revises certain requirements related to the REAL ID Act of 2005 (required enhanced driver's licenses for domestic flights) for purposes of boarding a federally regulated commercial aircraft.

Specifically, the bill

 exempts individuals with a known traveler number (assigned to an individual and accepted as validating that the individual holding such identifier is a member of a known low-risk population) from REAL ID requirements; requires the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to accept enrollment in PreCheck as an allowable alternative to presenting a REAL ID compliant credential to board a commercial aircraft until April 1, 2022; directs the TSA to develop, socialize, and implement alternative checkpoint screening procedures for individuals arriving at a checkpoint without a form of acceptable identification; provides an opportunity for airports to request the TSA to conduct REAL ID implementation exercises; and allows states to establish a process for the submission of electronic documents and electronic facial images when individuals are applying for a REAL ID compliant identification.</summary>
