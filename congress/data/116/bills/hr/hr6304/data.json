The SBA shall waive statutory limits on maximum loan maturities for certain loan durations where the lender provides a deferral and extends the maturity of such loans and, when necessary to provide more time because of difficulties during the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic, extend lender site visit requirements."
