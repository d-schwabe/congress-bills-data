  <summary date="2020-09-16T13:07:04Z" status="Passed House">21st Century Community Learning Centers Coronavirus Relief Act of 2020

This bill expresses the sense of Congress that the Department of Education (ED) should expand the allowable uses for subgrants provided under the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Program for the 2020-2021 school year.

Specifically, ED should carry out the exceptions published in a notice on September 3, 2020, by allowing eligible entities (e.g., local educational agencies and community-based organizations) that are awarded program subgrants for community learning centers to use these subgrants to (1) carry out activities that advance student academic achievement and support student success, regardless of whether such activities are conducted in person, virtually, during school hours, or when school is in session; and (2) provide in-person care during the regular school day and when full-time in-person instruction is not available to students. (Currently, the program only supports academic enrichment opportunities for children during non-school hours or periods when school is not in session.)</summary>
