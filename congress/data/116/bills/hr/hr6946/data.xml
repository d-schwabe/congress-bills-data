  <summary date="2020-05-19T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill directs the United States to withhold all contributions to the United Nations (U.N.) until (1) China's U.N. membership is terminated, and (2) Taiwan is granted full membership. (China considers Taiwan a part of China, and, as a result, the U.N. does not consider Taiwan a member state.)

The President shall direct the U.S. representative to the U.N. to encourage other member states to take similar action.</summary>
