Such allowance shall be reduced by the amount the President's earned income exceeds $400,000. These monetary amounts are subject to a cost-of-living increase.\n\nThe widow or widower of each such President shall be entitled to receive $100,000 per year, payable monthly, if such individual waives the right to each other annuity or pension to which the individual is entitled.
