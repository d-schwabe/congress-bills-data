Such funds may be used to cover costs or replace lost, delayed, or decreased revenues stemming from the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) public health emergency. In addition, the funds are designated as an emergency requirement, which exempts the funds from discretionary spending limits and other budget enforcement rules."
