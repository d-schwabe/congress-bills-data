This bill requires the Small Business Administration to develop a training curriculum on category management, including best practices for purchasing goods and services from small businesses, for the staff of federal agencies with procurement or acquisition responsibilities.

Category management is a federal government approach to procurement and acquisition that aims to (1) deliver more savings, value, and efficiency for federal agencies; (2) eliminate contract redundancies; and (3) meet federal small business contracting and procurement goals.</summary>
