This bill directs the Council of Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, an independent government entity that oversees the Offices of Inspectors General, to formally establish and maintain the oversight.gov website (which was launched in 2017) and authorizes funding through FY2030 to support the council's mission.

Specifically, the website shall (1) consolidate all public reports from each Office of Inspector General (including the Office of the Special Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery) to improve public access to any audit report, inspection report, or evaluation report made by an Office of Inspector General; and (2) include any additional resources, information, and enhancements as the council deems necessary or desirable.</summary>
