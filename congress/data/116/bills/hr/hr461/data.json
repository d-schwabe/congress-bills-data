    "text": "This bill requires hospitals with emergency departments to be equipped with sexual assault forensic examiners as a condition of participation in the 340B drug pricing program (i.e., a program that allows entities to receive covered outpatient drugs at reduced prices from manufacturers).\n\nSpecifically, the Department of Health and Human Services must designate the hospital as a facility in which a sexual assault forensic examiner is available or on call 24-7. Hospitals that do not receive this designation after one year must take action to become designated within the following year. They must also implement an interim policy that allows emergency department patients to choose to be transferred free of charge to already-designated facilities."
