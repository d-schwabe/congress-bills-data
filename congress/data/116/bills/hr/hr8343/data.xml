This bill requires the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to refer to the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee certain applications for premarket review of a new tobacco product, such as an e-cigarette. (Currently, the FDA may refer an application to the committee but is generally not required to do so.)

The FDA shall notify the committee when receiving such an application.

If the FDA intends to issue an order on an application, the FDA shall refer the application to the committee. With respect to a referred application, the committee shall make a public vote and issue recommendations about the application.

The committee must also make public a list of all applications for premarket review of new tobacco products.</summary>
