  <summary date="2020-08-14T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Tele-Mental Health Improvement Act This bill requires private health insurance plans that cover in-person mental health or substance use disorder services to cover such services on equal terms via telehealth (i.e., information technology used to aid treatment and diagnosis at a physical distance) during the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) public health emergency. Specifically, this bill requires, among other things, plans to cover such telehealth services at the same rate as in-person services, exclude charges for facility fees, and provide information about how to access such services.</summary>
