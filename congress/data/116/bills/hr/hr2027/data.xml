This bill prohibits the President from holding any asset that would be considered a disqualifying financial interest under applicable criminal code provisions.

The President may place any such asset into a blind trust, and the trustee or other entity who is involved in the management or control of the blind trust shall divest the blind trust of such asset.

A violation of this bill's prohibition constitutes an impeachable offense.</summary>
