    "text": "Affordable Limited Health Coverage Act\n\nThis bill nullifies a rule by the Departments of the Treasury, Labor, and Health and Human Services regarding short-term, limited-duration health insurance plans that was published on October 31, 2016. The departments must use the definition of short-term, limited-duration insurance in use immediately prior to publication of the rule. (The rule requires the duration of short-term, limited-duration insurance to be less than three months, including renewals. Previously, such insurance was required to expire less than 12 months after its effective date.)\n\nShort-term, limited-duration health insurance plans are plans that may only offer coverage for a limited amount of time under law and that are exempt from the market requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (e.g., coverage of individuals with preexisting conditions). On August 3, 2018, the departments issued a revised rule that increases the maximum authorized duration of such plans from less than 3 months (including renewals) to an initial maximum duration of less than 12 months (with a total duration of up to 36 months, including renewals). The rule took effect October 2, 2018."
