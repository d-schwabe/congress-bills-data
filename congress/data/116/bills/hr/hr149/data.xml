  <summary date="2019-01-03T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Veterans, Women, Families with Children, Race, and Persons with Disabilities Housing Fairness Act of 2019 or the Housing Fairness Act of 2019

This bill provides for testing to detect housing discrimination and awards grants to study the causes and effects of such discrimination.

Specifically, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) must conduct a nationwide testing program to (1) detect and document differences in the treatment of prospective renters, homebuyers, or mortgage borrowers; (2) measure patterns of adverse treatment because of the race, color, religion, sex, familial status, disability status, or national origin of a renter, homebuyer, or borrower; and (3) measure the prevalence of such discriminatory practices across housing and mortgage lending markets.

The bill also increases funding for the fair housing initiative program in FY2020-FY2024.

Additionally, HUD shall implement a grant program to assist public and private nonprofit organizations in (1) conducting comprehensive studies of the causes and effects of housing discrimination and segregation on education, poverty, and economic development or on veterans and military personnel; and (2) implementing pilot projects that test solutions to help prevent or alleviate housing discrimination and segregation.</summary>
