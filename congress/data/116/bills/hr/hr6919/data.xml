This bill requires the Department of Commerce to study and report on the impact of quantum computing on U.S. businesses conducting interstate commerce.

Such study shall involve, among other things, (1) listing industry sectors that develop and use quantum computing and public-private partnerships focused on promoting the adoption and use of quantum computing, (2) establishing a list of federal agencies asserting jurisdiction over such industry sectors and entities, and (3) assessing risks and trends in the marketplace and supply chain of quantum computing.

Commerce must report to Congress the results of such study and any recommendations to promote the adoption of quantum computing.</summary>
