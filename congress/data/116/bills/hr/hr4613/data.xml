This bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to establish and maintain a website that allows the public to obtain electronic copies of all legislatively requested reports required to be submitted after the date of the enactment of this bill. Information, records, and reports that are exempt from public disclosure are not required to be included on the website.

If Congress exempts a report from publication, the VA must publish on the website the title of the report and notice that Congress exempted the report from publication.

The VA must submit a report to Congress recommending which recurring legislatively requested reports should be discontinued.</summary>
