  <summary date="2020-09-16T12:59:04Z" status="Passed House">Equity and Inclusion Enforcement Act of 2019

 This bill authorizes private civil causes of action for disparate impact violations (to the same extent as intentional violations) of federal regulations of general applicability that prohibit discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in programs or activities receiving federal financial assistance.

Anti-Semitism shall be considered to be discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin.

Education programs that receive financial assistance authorized or extended by the Department of Education (ED) must designate at least one compliance coordinator to carry out these nondiscrimination responsibilities and investigate complaints.

The bill requires ED to appoint a Special Assistant for Equity and Inclusion to (1) promote, coordinate, and evaluate efforts to engender program compliance and inform individuals of their rights; and (2) advise ED on matters relating to compliance.</summary>
