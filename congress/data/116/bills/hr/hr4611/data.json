The city of San Diego may apply for permit modifications, which offer alternatives to certain secondary treatment standards.\n\nThis bill eliminates the need for the city to obtain a separate permit for such modifications. Instead, the city may apply to obtain the permit modifications under the main NPDES permit if the plant meets certain conditions, such as the implementation of a pretreatment program."
