(Presumptive eligibility allows qualifying individuals to receive services before their applications are fully processed.)\n\nSpecifically, the bill extends the applicable presumptive eligibility periods by five months. The bill also provides a 100% Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (i.e., federal matching rate) to states for expenses related to such eligibility determinations during the public health emergency relating to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019)."
