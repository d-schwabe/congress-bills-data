  <summary date="2020-11-12T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill requires the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to establish a National Coastal Data Information System.

NOAA must use the system to (1) combine existing observations, modeling, predictions, products and services into an integrated framework for producing and maintaining authoritative and timely data, maps, and information services which quantify and communicate coastal flood risk to the states; (2) develop and strengthen partnerships with organizations that represent end users within coastal communities to better assess information gaps and needs relating to the risk posed by the rising sea level; and (3) produce new information products and services, targeted to end-user needs, that allow coastal communities across the United States to plan for present and future coastal flood risk.</summary>
