  <summary date="2020-08-21T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">State Veterans Homes Domiciliary Care Flexibility Act

This bill authorizes the Department of Veterans Affairs to waive existing eligibility requirements for a veteran to receive per diem payments for domiciliary care at a state home if the veteran has met at least four of such requirements (e.g., can feed himself or herself), or the waiver would be in the best interest of the veteran. A state home is a home established by a state for veterans disabled by age, disease, or otherwise and are incapable of earning a living because of such disability. The term also includes a home that furnishes nursing home care for veterans.</summary>
