  <summary date="2020-06-11T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Holding China Accountable Act 

This bill prohibits certain Chinese nationals from receiving visas, requires higher education institutions to disclose certain foreign gifts, and restricts the use of foreign public accounting firms by foreign issuers of securities.

Specified visas may not be issued to Chinese nationals seeking to enter the United States for the purpose of (1) studying science, technology, engineering, mathematics, or a related field; (2) employment in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, or a related field; or (3) attending a business meeting, conference, or academic or cultural exchange that includes activities related to science, technology, engineering, mathematics, or a related field.

The bill also lowers the disclosure threshold regarding gifts to higher education institutions from China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea.

Additionally, the bill requires certain disclosures from foreign issuers of securities that use, for the required audit report to the Securities and Exchange Commission, a foreign public accounting firm that is not subject to inspection by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. If an issuer uses such a foreign public accounting firm, the issuer is generally prohibited from listing its securities on a national securities exchange.</summary>
