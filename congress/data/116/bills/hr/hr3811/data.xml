This bill directs the Department of Commerce to report to Congress a study of (1) international bodies that set technological standards relevant to internet-connected devices, and (2) the appropriate means to ensure robust U.S. leadership in such bodies. (Technological standards for emerging technologies, such as next-generation wireless data communications, are typically set by international bodies that comprise various stakeholders, such as equipment manufacturers in the relevant industries.)</summary>
