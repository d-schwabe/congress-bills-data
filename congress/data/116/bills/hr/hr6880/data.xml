This bill directs the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to coordinate the development of plans, designs, and guidance relating to the production of certain homeland security-critical supplies to address potential national emergencies and disasters.

Specifically, FEMA shall coordinate with other relevant federal departments and agencies

 to identify categories of homeland security-critical supplies that would be needed to address potential national emergencies or disasters, including any such public health emergency, terrorist incident, armed attack, or cyber attack; to develop plans, designs, and guidance relating to the production of the categories of homeland security-critical supplies identified to address the respective national emergencies and disasters, including such production by nontraditional manufacturers; and based on such final plans, designs, and guidance, to enter into such contingent arrangements with governmental and private entities to expedite the production of homeland security-critical supplies in the event of a national emergency or disaster. FEMA shall (1) publish each final plan, design, or guidance that is developed on a public website, except for protected information; and (2) at least every two years, coordinate the review and revision of each plan, design, and guidance in effect.</summary>
