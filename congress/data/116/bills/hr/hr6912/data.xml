  <summary date="2020-05-15T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">COVID-19 Youth Sports and Working Families Relief Act

This bill modifies the tax credit for household and dependent care expenses necessary for employment to include expenses for youth physical activities. Youth physical activities include organized individual and team sports, fitness and exercise, recreation, and other physical activities for youth who have attained age 4, but not age 18. The credit is refundable for taxable years beginning in 2020.

The bill also increases the dollar amount of the election for dependent care flexible spending arrangements.

The bill directs the Department of the Treasury to establish a relief fund for youth sport providers that directly serve youths age 18 and younger. The fund must disburse amounts to (1) alleviate losses sustained due to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019), (2) sustain existing organizations that without assistance may fail or have to severely curtail operations, and (3) maintain youth participation capacity.</summary>
