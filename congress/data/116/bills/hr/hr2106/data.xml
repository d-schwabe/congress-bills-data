  <summary date="2019-04-04T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill directs the Departments of the Interior and Agriculture (USDA) to assess an annual fee of up to $200 for any film crew of five persons or fewer to conduct commercial filming activities or similar projects on federal land administered by such departments and to require a one-year permit for such activities or projects that occur in areas designated for public use during public hours on federal land and waterways administered by such departments.

The bill also requires that the fee for a commercial filming activity or similar project in a unit of the National Park System be sufficient to cover the cost of a film permit and other administrative and personnel costs.

Interior and USDA must also assess an annual fee of up to $200 for still photography crews of five persons or fewer.

The bill repeals the requirement for collection by Interior and USDA of costs incurred as a result of filming activities or similar projects, including administrative and personnel costs, in addition to the reasonable fee assessed for commercial filming activities or similar projects in a system unit.</summary>
