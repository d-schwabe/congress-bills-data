This bill requires the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to increase outreach and engagement with owners and operators of critical infrastructure.

Specifically, the bill directs CISA to maintain a clearinghouse where owners and operators of critical infrastructure and other stakeholders may access security guidance, best practices, and other voluntary content developed by CISA. CISA must also issue a strategy to foster stakeholder outreach and operational engagement and establish a pilot program whereby law enforcement agencies and government officials may be trained by protective security advisors on carrying out vulnerability and risk assessments of facilities.</summary>
