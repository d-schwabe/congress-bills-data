The CFATS program requires chemical facilities to assess and address their threat vulnerabilities.\n\nThe bill requires DHS to (1) verify information submitted by a covered chemical facility prior to assigning such facility a lower risk tier or determining that such facility no longer presents a high level of security risk, and (2) develop a voluntary program for chemical facilities to address potential security risks.\n\nDHS shall, among other things (1) provide for an annual review of a facility's compliance with its emergency response plan; (2) make available to state, local, and regional fusion centers and state and local government officials such information as it deems necessary to ensure that emergency response providers are prepared and provided with the situational awareness needed to respond to security incidents; and (3) establish a Chemical Security Advisory Committee to advise DHS on the implementation of this bill.\n\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency shall (1) conduct a review of potential effects of attacks on covered chemical facilities or other critical infrastructure; and (2) establish a secure communications and information technology infrastructure or platform that allows facility owners and operators to voluntarily report on emerging threats, including terrorism threats posed by unmanned aircraft systems (i.e., drones) to covered chemical facilities.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office shall evaluate the effectiveness of DHS risk-based performance standards."
