Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. The Artemis program is the NASA program for going back to the Moon and for establishing sustainable exploration there.\n\nNASA\n\n shall establish a plan for the development and manufacture of advanced spacesuits; may carry out a program to conduct lunar science research, including missions to the surface of the Moon; shall ensure that the International Space Station (ISS) remains a viable and productive facility of potential U.S. use through at least FY2030; shall establish a low-Earth orbit development program to encourage commercial use and development of space by private entities in the United States; must update and improve the cybersecurity of its space assets and supporting infrastructure; and must maintain a Security Operations Center to identify and respond to cybersecurity threats to its information technology systems. The bill extends through 2030 authorization for cash or in-kind payments by the United States to Russia for certain work or services regarding the ISS."
