  <summary date="2020-08-11T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Aviation Manufacturing Jobs Protection Act of 2020 This bill makes available payroll assistance to eligible aviation employers impacted by the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) public health emergency. Specifically, aviation employers demonstrating that economic conditions require a permanent reduction or furlough of a portion of their employees may enter into an agreement with the Secretary of the Treasury to receive up to 50% of the amount of base compensation and benefits for the 25% of its employees most at risk of such reduction or furlough, excluding senior executive employees. Assistance under this program is available through April 30, 2022, and Treasury must establish an application process and minimum eligibility requirements for participation in the program not later than 10 days after the enactment of this bill.</summary>
