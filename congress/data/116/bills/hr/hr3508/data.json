The bill prohibits U.S. entities from investing in or insuring projects involving sanctioned entities in either sea.\n\nThe President shall also impose prohibitions and restrictions on correspondent and payable-through accounts related to sanctioned entities if the Office of the Director of National Intelligence determines that China has taken certain actions, such as declaring an air defense identification zone over the South China Sea.\n\nThe Government Publishing Office shall not publish any resources that portray the contested territories in either sea as part of China, with limited exceptions. The Department of Defense, U.S. flagged vessels, or U.S. aircraft may not take any action that implies recognition of China's claimed sovereignty over contested territories.\n\nThe State Department shall periodically report to Congress identifying countries that recognize China's claims to the contested territories. Certain types of foreign aid may not be provided to such countries."
