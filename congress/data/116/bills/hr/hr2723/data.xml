  <summary date="2019-05-14T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">National Multimodal and Sustainable Freight Infrastructure Act

This bill directs the Department of Transportation to improve the efficiency and reliability of freight movement in the United States by establishing (1) a Multimodal Freight Formula Program to distribute funds to each state based on the amount of existing infrastructure within the state; and (2) a National Freight Competitive Grant Program to provide grants to certain entities, including local governments and metropolitan planning organizations.

National and state freight plans must include strategies and goals to decrease greenhouse gas emissions, local air pollution, water runoff, and wildlife habitat loss.

The bill imposes a 1% excise tax upon the ground transportation cost of property and requires the deposit of such tax revenues into a Freight Trust Fund to finance the Multimodal Freight Formula Program and the National Freight Competitive Grant Program.</summary>
