The FDA may only decline approval if the FDA determines that the product is not safe or effective. The FDA must make such a determination not later than 30 days after receiving a request.\n\nCongress may pass a joint resolution to grant reciprocal marketing approval of a product that the FDA declines to approve through the reciprocal process."
