This bill requires private health insurance plans, including self-funded employer health plans, to display in online provider directories a method for notifying the plan about inaccurate provider information. Upon such notification, plans must correct and update the provider information in each directory within 30 days and submit an annual report to the state insurance commissioners in each state where the plan is available that contains the all corrective actions taken during the previous year.

Plans that do not comply with this requirement are subject to a tax penalty.</summary>
