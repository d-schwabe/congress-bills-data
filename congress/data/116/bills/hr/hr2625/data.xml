  <summary date="2019-05-09T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Long-term InVestment in Education and Wellness Act or the LIVE Well Act

This bill includes eating-disorder prevention and promotion of long-term health practices in the educational component of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP-Ed) and local school wellness policies created under the National School Lunch Program or other federal child nutrition programs. Under current law, states may elect to implement certain nutrition education and obesity prevention programs as part of SNAP-Ed; this bill requires the Department of Agriculture to specifically implement a nutrition education and obesity prevention program that includes a focus on long-term health practices.</summary>
