Such child care shall not be provided by any center or agency that employs a person who has been convicted of a sex crime, a crime involving a child victim, a violent crime, or a drug felony.\n\nThe bill requires the VA to inform eligible veterans of the available child care assistance.\n\nThe VA must post an easily accessible notice on a VA website describing the child care assistance benefit and eligibility requirements."
