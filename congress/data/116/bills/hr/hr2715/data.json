(Currently, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services approves Medicaid demonstration projects; such projects are also known as Section 1115 Demonstrations.)\n\nSpecifically, the project must provide enrollees who elect to participate with an EBT card to purchase primary care services; enrollees must receive any remaining balance at the end of the year in the form of a cash payment and must also obtain catastrophic health insurance."
