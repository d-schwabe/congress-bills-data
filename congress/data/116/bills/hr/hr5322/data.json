It also establishes the Minority Bank Deposit Program to ensure the use of minority banks and minority credit unions to the maximum extent possible to serve the financial needs of federal departments and agencies.\n\nFederal banking agencies must issue rules allowing new minority depository institutions and impact banks three years to meet capital requirements."
