The labeling for pesticides containing glyphosate must include specific wording, or shall be considered misbranded and subject to enforcement procedures.\n\nThe bill also requires the Department of Agriculture to annually test foods that are most likely to be consumed by infants and children (e.g., oats) for residues of glyphosate."
