This bill removes restrictions that require the originating site (i.e., the location of the beneficiary) to be in a rural area, and allows the home of a beneficiary to serve as the originating site, for behavioral health telehealth services under Medicare. The bill also expands the scope of required guidance, studies, and reports to address the provision of such services under Medicaid.</summary>
