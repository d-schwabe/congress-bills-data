  <summary date="2019-06-27T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Homegrown Act of 2019.

This bill removes marijuana from the list of scheduled substances under the Controlled Substances Act and eliminates criminal penalties for an individual who manufactures, distributes, or possesses with intent to distribute marijuana.

Additionally, the bill requires the Small Business Administration to establish the Equitable Licensing Grant Program. The purpose of the grant program is to support the implementation of cannabis licensing programs that minimize barriers to licensing and employment for individuals adversely impacted by the war on drugs.</summary>
