During the public comment period, written and oral comments may be submitted regarding the use of the facility at issue after the remedial action is taken.\n\nNotice of the final remedial action plan must be transmitted to the local government officials with jurisdiction over the facility at issue.\n\nFinally, the bill expands the minimum publication requirements for proposed and final plans to include an announcement via a radio or television station in the broadcast area surrounding the facility at issue. Additionally, any publications must be posted to the Environmental Protection Agency website."
