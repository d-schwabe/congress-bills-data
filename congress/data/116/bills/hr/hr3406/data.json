The bill excludes from the program SNFs for which there is not a minimum number of applicable cases or measures, as set by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), for the performance period. Additionally, the bill allows the CMS to apply up to 10 additional quality measures, including measures relating to patient safety and care coordination."
