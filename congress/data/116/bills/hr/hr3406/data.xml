  <summary date="2019-06-21T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill modifies requirements relating to the Medicare skilled nursing facility (SNF) value-based purchasing program, which provides incentive payments to SNFs based on their quality of care.

Currently, all Medicare SNFs are included in the program, and their quality of care is determined based on a hospital readmissions measure. The bill excludes from the program SNFs for which there is not a minimum number of applicable cases or measures, as set by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS), for the performance period. Additionally, the bill allows the CMS to apply up to 10 additional quality measures, including measures relating to patient safety and care coordination.</summary>
