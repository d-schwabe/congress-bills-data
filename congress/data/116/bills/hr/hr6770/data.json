    "text": "Mobility Options, Resiliency, and Efficiency (MORE) through TDM Act\n\nThis bill addresses supporting transportation demand management (TDM) expectations and goals that will serve the mobility needs of the people and freight, foster economic growth and development within and between states and urbanized areas. (Transportation demand management is the use of strategies to inform and encourage travelers to maximize the efficiency of a transportation system leading to improved mobility, reduced congestion, and lower vehicle emissions.)\n\nEach state and metropolitan planning organization must include TDM targets in the development of their long-range transportation plans.\n\nThe bill directs the Department of Transportation (DOT) to establish a program to encourage and assist the development and funding of TDM related projects.\n\nAdditionally, DOT must provide grants to nonprofit institutions of higher education to establish and operate a university transportation center for research and development related to TDM and TDM strategies. (TDM strategies means the use of planning, programs, policy, marketing, communications, incentives, pricing, and technology to shift travel mode, routes used, departure times, number of trips, and location and design work space or public attractions.)\n\nThe bill establishes a National Advisory Committee under the Federal Highways Administration to strategically direct federal resources and policies toward implementation of TDM objectives. Additionally, each state must establish advisory committees focused on the development and furthering of the principles of TDM."
