  <summary date="2019-07-24T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill expands the situations&#160;in which&#160;the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers must provide information and assistance to the public and affected governments and Indian tribes in river basins where the corps&#160;carries out flood risk management activities. Specifically, the corps must provide these services when the National Weather Service forecasts a possibility that precipitation or runoff will exceed the calculations considered as the lowest risk to life and property contemplated by the annual operating plan. Current law directs the corps to do so only when precipitation or runoff actually exceeds such calculations.</summary>
