The USOPC and the national governing bodies shall not interfere in or attempt to influence the outcome of an investigation.\n\nThe center shall report to Congress within 72 hours of an attempt to interfere in, or influence the outcome of, an investigation.\n\nThe bill establishes within the legislative branch the Commission on the State of U.S. Olympics and Paralympics to study matters relating to the state of U.S. participation in the Olympic and Paralympic Games. The bill prohibits retaliation against protected individuals (including amateur athletes, coaches, and trainers) because of disclosures pertaining to sexual abuse or harassment."
