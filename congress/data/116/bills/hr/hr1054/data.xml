This bill addresses the capacity of historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) to participate in federal programs.

Specifically, the bill requires agencies that regularly interact with HBCUs to submit annual plans for strengthening the capacity of HBCUs to participate in federal programs. Among other things, the plans must establish how the agencies intend to increase the capacity of HBCUs to compete effectively for grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements.

Agencies that do not work regularly with HBCUs must submit annual plans to identify specific HBCU initiatives and resources that could benefit the HBCU community.

The agencies may provide technical assistance and information to the initiative to enhance communication with HBCUs concerning their program activities and applications for grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements.

In addition, the bill provides statutory authority for the President's Board of Advisors on HBCUs.</summary>
