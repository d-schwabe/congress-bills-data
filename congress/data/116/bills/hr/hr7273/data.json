In implementing the program, the Forest Service shall give priority to projects that protect or restore\n\n water quality and watershed function; a watershed that supplies a public drinking water system; the habitat of a threatened, endangered, or sensitive fish or wildlife species, or a species of conservation concern; or a watershed for which the Forest Service has completed a watershed protection and restoration action plan. The Forest Service shall identify the minimum road system needed for each unit of the National Forest System.\n\nThe Forest Service shall develop a national strategy to carry out the program."
