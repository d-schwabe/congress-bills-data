  <summary date="2019-12-10T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill prevents the Department of Education from finalizing&#160;its 2018 proposed rule that proposes to modify the prohibition of sex discrimination under title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.

Currently, title IX prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in federally funded education programs or activities. Among other things, the proposed rule defines the conduct that constitutes sexual harassment and outlines the conditions that trigger a school's obligation to respond to allegations of sexual harassment.</summary>
