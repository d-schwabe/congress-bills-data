Among other requirements, an arrest must be based on probable cause and must occur on the federal property itself, in the immediate vicinity, or in an area that is covered by an agreement between DHS and another agency or state or local government; arrests may be made in other areas if part of an active pursuit.\n\nDHS officers and agents must also (1) display appropriate insignia and their full name while on duty, (2) identify themselves while making an arrest, and (3) inform the individual being arrested as to the cause of the arrest."
