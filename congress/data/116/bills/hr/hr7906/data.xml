This bill establishes and modifies several requirements for officers and agents of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) who are designated to protect federal property.

In particular, the bill adds specificity to the circumstances under which DHS officers and agents may place individuals under arrest for a felony (without a warrant) in and around federal property. Among other requirements, an arrest must be based on probable cause and must occur on the federal property itself, in the immediate vicinity, or in an area that is covered by an agreement between DHS and another agency or state or local government; arrests may be made in other areas if part of an active pursuit.

DHS officers and agents must also (1) display appropriate insignia and their full name while on duty, (2) identify themselves while making an arrest, and (3) inform the individual being arrested as to the cause of the arrest.</summary>
