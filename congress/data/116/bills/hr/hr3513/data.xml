  <summary date="2019-06-26T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Patsy T. Mink and Louise M. Slaughter Gender Equity in Education Act of 2019

This bill requires the Department of Education (ED) to establish an Office for Gender Equity to support state and local educational agencies, institutions of higher education, and elementary and secondary schools in fully implementing title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in federally funded education programs or activities. The office may provide grants and perform activities to reduce or prevent sex discrimination in all areas of education.

The office must provide technical assistance and annual training to title IX coordinators and develop a handbook for conducting self-evaluations of title IX compliance. The training must address discrimination based on multiple characteristics, including race, ethnicity, national origin, disability status, religion, age, actual or perceived sex, sexual orientation, or gender or gender identity.

The office may award grants to eligible entities and partnerships that apply to carry out programs and activities designed to implement title IX and prevent and reduce sex discrimination, including programs that increase campus resources.

ED must coordinate with the Institute of Education Sciences and other federal entities to investigate, identify, and disseminate best practices to (1) reduce and prevent sex stereotyping, bias, and discrimination in educational materials; (2) address sex-based harassment and violence on campuses; (3) develop counseling and career guidance training; (4) mitigate implicit bias in teaching and discipline; and (5) address the needs of students who face discrimination based on multiple characteristics.</summary>
