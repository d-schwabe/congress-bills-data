  <summary date="2020-03-19T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Rapid Coverage of COVID-19 Vaccine Act of 2020

This bill shortens the time frame under which private health insurance plans must cover certain new preventative services related to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019). Under current law, health plans have one year to cover services recommended by the United States Preventive Services Task Force or the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Under this bill, health plans must cover such services to prevent or diagnose COVID-19 within 15 days.</summary>
