  <summary date="2020-03-23T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill expands during FY2020 foster-care programs for older youth. Among other changes, the bill (1) increases the federal proportion of funding for foster-care services, (2) extends eligibility for such services through age 25, (3) suspends the limit on state expenditures on housing for youth who have aged out of foster care, and (4) suspends the five-year time limit on eligibility for older youth to receive education and training vouchers.

Additionally, state agencies must conduct outreach for enrollment in Medicaid to eligible individuals who have aged out of foster care.</summary>
