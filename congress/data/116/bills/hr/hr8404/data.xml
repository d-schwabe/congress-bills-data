This bill requires public housing agencies (PHAs) to take certain actions when selling or leasing assets in connection with a solar energy project.

Specifically, a PHA must ensure that such a sale or lease financially benefits the residents of the public housing project as well as the budget of the PHA. Further, if a buyer or lessee intends to derive a product or service from the asset, the PHA must require that the product or service be offered and provided to residents of the public housing project before being offered and provided to nonresidents.

Additionally, a PHA must include certain information regarding assets it intends to sell or lease in the upcoming year in its annual plan.</summary>
