This bill makes an institution of higher education (IHE) that is a sanctuary campus ineligible for federal student aid funds. In general, a sanctuary campus is an IHE that has a policy of restricting its personnel from cooperating with federal officials in enforcing the immigration laws and that harbors and provides educational benefits to aliens who lack a lawful immigration status.

The Department of Homeland Security must transmit to the Department of Education and publish in the Federal Register notice of a determination that an IHE is a sanctuary campus.

The bill expresses the sense of Congress that providing in-state tuition to an alien who lacks lawful immigration status in the United States creates an incentive for illegal immigration and encourages and induces aliens to come to, enter, or reside in the United States.</summary>
