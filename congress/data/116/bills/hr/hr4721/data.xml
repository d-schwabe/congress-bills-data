This bill prohibits&#160;the use of&#160;federal funds to support or&#160;facilitate Russia's participation in a proceeding of the&#160;Group of Seven (a group consisting of the seven largest major advanced economies, as determined by the International Monetary Fund) or to&#160;reconstitute the Group of Eight to include Russia. (Russia was disinvited from the Group of Eight in 2014 after it occupied parts of Ukraine, including the Crimea region.)

This prohibition shall terminate after the Department of State certifies that Russia (1) has halted all interference into U.S. elections; (2) has ended its occupation of Crimea and is implementing its commitments under certain agreements related to Ukraine; and (3) has&#160;taken steps to end its campaign to divide western economic, political, and security institutions.</summary>
