The bill defines low-vision device to mean a physician-prescribed device that magnifies, enhances, or otherwise augments or interprets visual images; the term does not include ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses.\n\n The bill appropriates $2.5 million\u00a0for FY2020 and each of the next four fiscal\u00a0years for the CMS to carry out the project."
