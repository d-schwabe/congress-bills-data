This bill expands eligibility for trade adjustment assistance to a group of workers who are separated, or threatened to be separated, from a firm because of a decrease in the firm's sales, production, or both owing to disruptions in global supply chains affected by COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019).

Trade adjustment assistance seeks to provide adversely affected workers with assistance obtaining the credentials, resources, and support to build skills for future jobs.</summary>
