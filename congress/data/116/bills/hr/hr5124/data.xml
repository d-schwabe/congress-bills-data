  <summary date="2019-11-15T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Southern New England Regional Commission Act

This bill establishes the Southern New England Regional Commission. (Federal regional commissions address perceived regional economic underdevelopment.) The commission is given the same structure and duties as the Southeast Crescent Regional Commission, Southwest Border Regional Commission, and Northern Border Regional Commission.

The bill authorizes those commissions, in addition to their current authorities, to (1) support the maritime economy, (2) assist in developing defense manufacturing industries, and (3) promote the adoption of innovative materials in public transportation.</summary>
