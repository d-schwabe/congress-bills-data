  <summary date="2020-05-12T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">COVID-19 Funeral Assistance Fund

This bill directs the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to provide financial assistance to individuals (both citizens and nonresident aliens) and funeral homes for the funeral expenses of an individual who died of COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) without sufficient insurance to pay for such expenses, through the establishment of a COVID-19 Funeral Assistance Fund.

The bill requires an application for assistance to include certain information, including (1) the amount of funeral expenses incurred between January 21, 2020, and December 31, 2020, and (2) proof that COVID-19 was the direct or indirect cause of death of the deceased individual. The bill also limits assistance for funeral expenses to $10,000 for each deceased individual and prohibits FEMA from requiring residence in a presidentially-declared disaster area as a condition for receiving assistance.</summary>
