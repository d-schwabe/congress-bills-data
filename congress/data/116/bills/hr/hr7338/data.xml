This bill modifies requirements relating to coverage of telehealth services under Medicare. Among other things, the bill authorizes the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services to generally waive coverage restrictions at any time and for any area. The bill also permanently allows federally qualified health centers and rural health clinics to serve as the distant site (i.e., the location of the health care practitioner) for telehealth services.</summary>
