A jurisdiction may petition HUD to apply such an adjustment, however.\n\nQualified low-income buildings may not receive a low-income housing credit unless they provide to the relevant housing\u00a0credit agency certain information required by HUD to determine program compliance.\n\nThe bill also authorizes through FY2029 certain assistance for jurisdictions for which HUD has applied, or would have applied in the absence of this bill, a high housing cost adjustment."
