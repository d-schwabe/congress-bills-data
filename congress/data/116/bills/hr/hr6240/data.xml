This bill requires federal agencies to develop plans to increase diversity in the workforce.

Specifically, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) must develop a plan to increase diversity in the executive branch of government that includes specified information, including strategies for agencies to remove barriers to equal employment opportunities. Each executive agency must develop an agency-specific plan to increase diversity, pursuant to OPM and OMB guidance, and annually publish specified data. The legislative and judicial branches of government must also implement these requirements to the greatest extent possible.

Additionally, each executive agency, and each prime contractor that is under contract with an executive agency, must annually report information relating to economically and socially disadvantaged businesses.</summary>
