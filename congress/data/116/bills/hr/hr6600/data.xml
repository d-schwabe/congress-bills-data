  <summary date="2020-04-23T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Point-of-Care Testing Prize Competitions Act of 2020

This bill requires the National Institutes of Health (NIH), in consultation with the National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST), to conduct a prize competition for institutions of higher education in order to incentivize research on point-of-care testing that is capable of detecting current or past infection with COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) and meets other&#160;specified criteria. The NIST must assist the NIH with the development of certain validation protocols and standards for the testing.</summary>
