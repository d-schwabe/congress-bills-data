This bill requires any federal agency that sustained specified damage as a result of a presidentially-declared major disaster to submit to Congress and the Office of Management and Budget a report that describes the damage incurred, an estimate of the cost of such damage, and any effects to operations if the agency does not receive additional resources.

Specified damage is defined as

 damage to federal facilities and property; negative impacts on federal operations, including damage to equipment, loss of program support, and any other calculable costs, as well as costs necessary to resume operations; and loss of services, totaling a cost exceeding $500,000, that would have been provided by the agency but for the disaster. The bill provides for expedited consideration of a bill making supplemental appropriations to agencies in response to such report.</summary>
