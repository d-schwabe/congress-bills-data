This bill prohibits private health insurance plans from (1) reducing reimbursement rates to health care providers, or (2) terminating a contract with a health care provider in any area where there is a federally-declared public health emergency. The bill does not limit such actions if they are based on fraud, abuse, or concern about the quality of the provider or if the provider is on the exclusion list from federal health programs that is maintained by the Department of Health and Human Services.</summary>
