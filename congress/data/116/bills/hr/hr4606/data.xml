This bill addresses school security by, among other requirements, mandating that each elementary school and secondary school have a silent alarm to alert local law enforcement authorities and emergency responders about a safety issue at the school.

It conditions receipt of funds by a local educational agency upon each elementary and secondary school served by such agency being equipped with at least one panic alarm for use in a school emergency.

The bill reauthorizes the school resource officers program for FY2021-FY2030.</summary>
