  <summary date="2019-12-17T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Sandy Duplication of Benefits Fairness Act

This bill expands the applicability of the waiver of the prohibition against duplication of benefits for disaster relief recipients following Superstorm Sandy. Under current law, the waiver period extends from January 1, 2016, through December 31, 2021. This bill begins that period on October 1, 2012, through December 31, 2021. This change would permit individuals who suffered losses resulting from Superstorm Sandy and who initially applied for and received federal benefits, including Small Business Administration disaster relief loans, to receive additional federal benefits, including funds under the Department of Housing and Urban Development Block Grant for Disaster Relief (CDBG-DR), without having to repay such additional benefits.</summary>
