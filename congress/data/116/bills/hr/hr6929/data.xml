This bill requires the Department of Commerce to study and report on the impact of facial recognition on U.S. businesses conducting interstate commerce.

Such study shall involve, among other things, (1) listing industry sectors that develop and use facial recognition technology and public-private partnerships focused on promoting the adoption and use of such technology, (2) establishing a list of federal agencies asserting jurisdiction over such industry sectors and entities, (3) assessing risks and trends in the marketplace and supply chain of facial recognition technology, and (4) identifying potential harms to individuals related to the use of such technology.

Commerce must report to Congress the results of such study and any recommendations to promote the adoption of facial recognition technology.</summary>
