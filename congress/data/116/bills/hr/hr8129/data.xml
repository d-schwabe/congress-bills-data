This bill requires the Department of Transportation to provide competitive grants to states to educate the public on the dangers of drug-impaired driving.

A state may use the grant to provide funds to local government agencies, Indian tribal governments, and nonprofit organizations in such state that will educate the public on the dangers of drug-impaired driving.

A state that receives a grant or an entity using funds provided by a state must use certain evidence and strategies to educate the public, including those recommended by the Congressional Research Service in the publication titled Marijuana Use and Highway Safety, published on May 14, 2019.</summary>
