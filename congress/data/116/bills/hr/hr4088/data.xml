  <summary date="2019-07-26T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Superfund Reinvestment Act

 This bill authorizes the use of amounts in the Hazardous Substance Superfund for environmental cleanup costs under the Superfund program (which provides funding to clean up sites contaminated with hazardous substances).

Receipts and disbursements of the Hazardous Substance Superfund must (1) not be counted for purposes of the President's budget, the congressional budget, the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, or the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010; (2) be exempt from general budget limitations imposed by statute on expenditures and net lending; and (3) be available only for the purposes specified under Superfund.

This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to (1) reinstate through 2028, and adjust for inflation annually after 2020, the Hazardous Substance Superfund financing rate and the corporate environmental income tax threshold amount; (2) extend the borrowing authority of the Superfund through 2028; and (3) modify the definition of crude oil for purposes of the excise tax on petroleum and petroleum products to include a bitumen or bituminous mixture (e.g., tar sands), oil derived from a bitumen or bituminous mixture, and oil derived from kerogen-bearing sources (e.g., shale oil).</summary>
