Among other things, such standards must include a requirement that no individual shall be required to wait longer than one hour to cast a vote at a polling place.\n\nThe bill requires each state to comply with the national standards established by the EAC.\n\nAdditionally, the EAC must study (1) instances of the misidentification by election officials of the political party registration of individuals attempting to vote in primary elections for federal office, and (2) instances of states purging their official voter registration lists to automatically remove individuals who do not vote."
