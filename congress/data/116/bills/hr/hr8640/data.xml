This bill establishes the Public Health Oversight Panel and sets out its duties and membership.

Generally, the panel must, in consultation with relevant advisory bodies, advise Public Health Service agencies on the scientific basis for their actions.

In addition, during public health emergencies, the agencies must provide the panel with the opportunity to review the scientific basis of their regulatory activities. The agencies may not issue a regulation, order, or other guidance if the panel determines that the scientific basis of the action is incorrect or that the evidence to support the scientific basis is insufficient.</summary>
