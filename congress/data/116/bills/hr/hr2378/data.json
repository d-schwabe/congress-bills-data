The individual may be naturalized upon compliance with the relevant immigration law requirements, except that no prior residence or specified U.S. physical presence shall be required. A surviving spouse seeking naturalization must have been living in marital union with the officer at the time of death.\n\nPublic safety officers include law enforcement officers, firefighters, or chaplains, and certain Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) employees engaged in hazardous duties."
