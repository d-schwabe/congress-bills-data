  <summary date="2020-03-05T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Equal Treatment of Faith-Based Organizations Act of 2020

This bill provides statutory authority for certain restrictions on conditions for financial assistance and program participation imposed&#160;by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) with respect to faith-based organizations.

Specifically, HHS shall not impose specified conditions on&#160;faith-based organizations regarding&#160;the receipt of HHS funds or the participation in HHS programs, such as requirements to disclose religious affiliation, if those conditions&#160;are not imposed on organizations that are not faith-based. In addition, HHS shall not require any organization to refer a beneficiary who objects to the religious character of that organization to an alternative provider. States and local governments that administer HHS funds must adhere to these requirements, as well.

Under current law, these restrictions apply to HHS financial assistance and programs through an executive order concerning the administration of federal grants and programs related to faith-based organizations.</summary>
