This bill provides statutory authority for&#160;a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer to conduct asylum interviews to determine whether an alien has a credible fear of persecution, provided that the officer meets existing training and supervision requirements. (Asylum officers have typically been part of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which administers the immigration system, while the CBP is a law enforcement agency.)</summary>
