  <summary date="2020-08-25T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Emergency Support for Nursing Homes and Elder Justice Reform Act of 2020

This bill establishes a series of requirements relating to the quality of care provided in nursing and long-term care facilities, specifically with respect to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) and elder abuse, and also modifies and extends several elder justice programs and initiatives.

Among other things, the bill (1) requires a portion of any funds received through COVID-19 appropriations to be used for personal protective equipment and testing in Medicare skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), Medicaid nursing facilities (NFs), and long-term care facilities, including assisted living facilities, and for specialized strike teams to address outbreaks in SNFs and NFs; (2) requires SNFs, NFs, and long-term care facilities to report COVID-19 cases and deaths, as well as unrelated deaths, from January 1, 2020, onwards and on a continual daily basis; and (3) requires a specified portion of COVID-19 appropriations to be directed to state and tribal agencies responsible for adult protective services.

Additionally, the bill reauthorizes through FY2023 (1) grants to support state long-term care ombudsman programs, (2) elder abuse forensic centers, and (3) grants to support state adult protective services.</summary>
