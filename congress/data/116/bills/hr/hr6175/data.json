It also allows the credit for buildings within a half-mile of public transportation facilities, for residential lodging purposes, and for expenses related to building expansion on the same block as a qualified rehabilitation building.\n\nThe bill allows a 25% credit for rent-restricted housing units and for expenses related to public infrastructure projects required by state or local governments as a condition of project completion."
