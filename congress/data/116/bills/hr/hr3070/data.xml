This bill requires the Department of Education (ED) to carry out a program under which ED makes grants to states to assist them in carrying out activities designed to help a transition-aged youth (i.e., a person considered to be a transition-aged youth under the laws of the state concerned) with covered disabilities obtain customized, competitive integrated employment. These disabilities include intellectual, developmental, mental health, physical, or other significant disability that presents barriers to an individual transitioning to employment or postsecondary education.</summary>
