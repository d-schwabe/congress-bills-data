This bill requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to report to Congress a plan to expeditiously scan all commercial and passenger vehicles entering the United States at a land port of entry using large-scale non-intrusive inspection systems, such as X-ray and gamma-ray imaging systems, or similar technology. The plan shall include elements such as (1) an inventory of such systems currently in use, (2) the estimated costs of achieving a 100% scanning rate, and (3) the anticipated impact that increasing the scanning rate will have on wait times at land ports of entry. DHS shall periodically report to Congress on the progress in implementing the plan.

DHS shall also research and develop technology enhancements to inspection areas at land ports of entry.</summary>
