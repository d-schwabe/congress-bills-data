  <summary date="2020-02-03T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Clearing Lines along Electrical At-Risk Zones Act

This bill revises requirements related to vegetation managment practices and forest management activities.

The bill redefines hazard trees as trees that come within 50 feet (rather than 10 feet, as under current law) of an electric power line. Hazard trees are subject to certain management activities under current law.

A vegetation management, facility inspection, and operation and maintenance plan shall describe processes for consultation with private landowners with respect to hazard trees identified for removal.

Such plans must be approved according to specified deadlines.

The bill generally excludes specified forest management activities from certain environmental assessment and environmental impact statement requirements. Specifically, the bill excludes from these requirements (1) the development and approval of a vegetation management, facility inspection, and operation and maintenance plan; and (2) the implementation of routine activities conducted under such a plan.The use of this exclusion shall not be subject to extraordinary circumstances procedures.</summary>
