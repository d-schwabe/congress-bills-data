Health care workers, which include physicians and support staff, among others, are eligible for a maximum of $35,000 in aggregate hazard pay. Essential workers, as determined by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, are eligible for a maximum of $25,000 in aggregate hazard pay. The Department of the Treasury must make payments to employers based on an employer's quarterly projections of the number of hours worked by eligible employees, including specified hours worked prior to the enactment of this bill. Employers must issue hazard payments to eligible employees not later than 14 days after receiving such payment from Treasury. The bill establishes and provides funding for the Coronavirus Essential and High-Risk Health Care Workers Hazard Payment Fund to implement this program."
