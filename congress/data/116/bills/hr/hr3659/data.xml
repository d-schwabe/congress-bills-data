This bill establishes the Anti-Bullying Roundtable as an independent commission to study and report on bullying in&#160;elementary and secondary schools in the United States.

Specifically, the roundtable must submit to the Department of Education (ED), and ED must make publicly available, a report on best practices concerning bullying, including cyberbullying. The report must contain recommendations for (1)&#160;preventing bullying, (2) educating school officials to recognize bullying, (3) helping parents to address the early warning signs of bullying with their children, (4) addressing the underlying causes of bullying behavior, and (5) addressing bullying of at-risk students. Further, the report must include examples of successful evidence-based bullying prevention programming.

In addition, the roundtable must submit a final report to ED and Congress containing (1) a detailed statement of its findings and conclusions, and (2) recommendations for lawmakers regarding effective bullying prevention policies.</summary>
