This bill directs the Department of Transportation (DOT) to establish a pilot program to improve the application of public health risk mitigation measures related to the public health risks presented by COVID-19 (i.e. coronavirus disease 2019) in airports and on passenger aircraft.

DOT may provide grants under the program to states, commercial airlines, airports, public health institutions, and other entities to to carry out development, testing, or evaluation of such public health risk mitigation measures.

DOT, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) must each designate federal facilities for receiving, processing, and analyzing data collected and experience gained by recipients of grants under the program.

DOT, DHS, and HHS must use the data collected and experience gained to (1) jointly identify technical, regulatory, or policy challenges to the integration of public health risk mitigation measures related to the public health risks created by COVID-19 in airports and on passenger aircraft; and (2) inform ongoing initiatives by the Federal Aviation Administration, the Transportation Security Administration, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to develop operational standards and procedures to mitigate such public health risks.</summary>
