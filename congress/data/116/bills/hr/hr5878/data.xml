This bill directs the Department of State and the U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations to use the voice, vote, and influence of the United States in both bilateral relationships and multilateral organizations to promote the adoption of a binding Global Migration Agreement.

Such agreement should, among other things, address the root causes of migration, centralize the human rights of migrants, and provide global funding for crisis response involving at-risk migrants.</summary>
