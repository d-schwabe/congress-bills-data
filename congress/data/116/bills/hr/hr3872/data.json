The bill also revises administrative provisions of NFIP, including by\n\n allowing for the continuous operation of NFIP during a lapse in appropriations, and prohibiting the Department of the Treasury from charging FEMA interest for NFIP debt for five years. The bill sets forth requirements for Write Your Own companies related to reimbursements, agent commissions, and penalties for underpayment of claims. (A Write Your Own company writes and services federal standard flood insurance policies in its own name.)\n\nThe bill establishes a state revolving fund for flood mitigation activities and also provides for loans, grants, and other incentives regarding mitigation."
