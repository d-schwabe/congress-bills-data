This bill establishes allows the use of certain foreign assistance funds to provide training and support for foreign-government law-enforcement forces. However, such funds may not be used to (1) provide assistance otherwise prohibited, such as assistance for units that the Department of State believes have&#160;committed gross human-rights violations; (2) provide assistance that the State Department believes would aggravate or substantially contribute to corruption, human-rights violations, or suppression of dissent; or (3) support any foreign-government intelligence or surveillance program.

Currently, such funds may not be used for such training and assistance, with various exceptions such as where the recipient country has a longstanding democratic tradition and does not have standing armed forces or a history of committing gross human-rights violations.</summary>
