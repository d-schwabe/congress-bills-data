The reasonable restrictions must be implemented at the expense of the air carriers.\n\nAdditionally, during a public health emergency, the Department of Transportation must waive any grant assurance that conflicts with a reasonable restriction implemented by a state, territory, or Indian Tribe without an airport owner or operator submitting a request for such a waiver."
