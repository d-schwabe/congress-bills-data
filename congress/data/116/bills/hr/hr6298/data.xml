  <summary date="2020-03-19T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">COVID-19 WIC Response Act of 2020

This bill modifies food and nutrition programs of the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to allow certain waivers and deferments of requirements under the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) during public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) outbreak.

Specifically, USDA may

 grant waivers allowing participants under WIC to get certified or recertified without being physically present at a WIC clinic; defer anthropometric and bloodwork requirements necessary to determine nutritional risk; and grant waivers from administrative requirements for WIC if it determines that the requirement cannot be met by a state due to COVID-19, and the waiver is necessary to provide assistance under WIC. USDA authority under this bill expires on July 31, 2020.</summary>
