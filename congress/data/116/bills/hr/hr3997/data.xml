This bill prohibits certain individuals with security clearances from receiving funding or employment from specified entities. Specifically, the prohibition is in effect while a security clearance is active and for five years afterwards, and applies to any (1) officer or employee of a federal agency or contractor, or (2) member of the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps.

The prohibition shall apply to specified entities such as Huawei Technologies Company and Kaspersky Lab. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence may add to or remove from this list based on whether there is a reasonable belief that an entity is owned by or receives financial support from the government of China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea.

A person who knowingly violates this prohibition shall be subject to fines or imprisonment, or both.</summary>
