  <summary date="2020-04-03T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Northern Border Regional Commission Financial Flexibility Act

This bill temporarily increases the maximum percentage that certain federal regional commissions may contribute toward infrastructure projects in distressed counties (i.e., counties that are the most economically distressed and underdeveloped and have high rates of poverty, unemployment, or outmigration).

Specifically, for grants awarded between January 1, 2019-December 31, 2021, the bill allows the Southeast Crescent Regional Commission, the Southwest Border Regional Commission, and the Northern Border Regional Commission (NBRC) to contribute 100% of costs for projects in distressed counties. (Currently, only the NBRC is active.)</summary>
