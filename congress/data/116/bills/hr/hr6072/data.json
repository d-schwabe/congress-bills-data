Currently, Coast Guard retirement and survivor benefit payments come out of the yearly Coast Guard budget as a mandatory appropriation. Such payments are not paid in the event of a government shutdown; however, retirement benefits for other branches of the military are still paid through the Military Retirement Fund."
