This bill reduces the required frequency of student achievement tests in mathematics and reading or language arts. Currently, students must be tested in those areas against state academic content and achievement standards in each of grades three through eight. This bill instead requires that those tests be administered at least once during grades 3 through 5, grades 6 through 9, and grades 10 through 12.</summary>
