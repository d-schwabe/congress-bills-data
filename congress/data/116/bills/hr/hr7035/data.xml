This bill authorizes the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to provide grants to eligible entities under the local agriculture market program for COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) losses.

Eligible entities must submit USDA an application containing (1) a description of how the applicant's business has been impacted by COVID-19, (2) a narrative explaining how the applicant proposes to use such payments to expand the capacity of their sales in order to properly package and sell agricultural products to consumers either through grocery stores or direct sale, and (3) other information as USDA may require.</summary>
