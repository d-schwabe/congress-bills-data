    "text": "Terminating the Extension of Rights Misappropriated Act of 2019 or the Term Act of 2019\n\nThis bill addresses double patenting with respect to drug-related patents. Specifically, the bill requires an owner of drug-related patents, if the owner\u00a0lists more than one patent as covering a particular drug, to prove in certain proceedings that each patent covers a distinct invention. If the patent owner fails to do so, then the owner\u00a0shall have disclaimed patent protection from all the listed patents after the first patent expires.\n\nThis requirement shall apply to various proceedings challenging the validity of drug-related patents, as well as to infringement lawsuits filed by the patent owner against companies seeking Food and Drug Administration approval for generic or biosimilar versions of patented drugs.\n\nThe bill also directs the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to review its examination procedures to prevent granting multiple patents for the same drug or biological product, unless the patents cover distinct inventions. The USPTO shall report to Congress its findings and recommendations from the review."
