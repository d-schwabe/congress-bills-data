    "text": "Consumers Rebate to ban Emissions and Boost AlTernative Energy Act or the Consumers REBATE Act\n\nThis bill imposes an excise tax on the carbon dioxide content of coal, oil, and natural gas. The tax must be paid by the producer, miner, or importer of the taxable carbon substance and does not apply to exports of the substances.\n\nBeginning in 2021, the tax rate is $25 per ton of carbon dioxide content of the life-cycle emissions from the taxable carbon substance. After 2021, the tax increases by $10 each year and does not apply if specified emissions reduction benchmarks have been attained.\n\nThe bill also includes provisions that require certain fees or refunds for taxable carbon substances that are exported or imported.\n\nFunds equivalent to the revenues received from the tax must be transferred to a Carbon Trust Fund established by this bill. The funds must be used, as provided by appropriations Acts, to offset reductions in individual income tax rates, pay quarterly dividends to certain individuals with valid Social Security numbers; and for specified worker transition assistance, energy, research, and infrastructure priorities."
