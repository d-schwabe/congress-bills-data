This bill authorizes the President to impose sanctions on a foreign individual or company that has engaged in egregious behaviors that undermine efforts to limit global warming.

Specifically, the President may impose visa-blocking, property-blocking, or economic sanctions upon a determination that a foreign individual or company has (1) caused significant excess greenhouse gas emissions associated with electrical power generation; (2) caused significant or illegal deforestation or loss of natural carbon sinks; or (3) knowingly misrepresented the environmental impact of a project, investment, or product.</summary>
