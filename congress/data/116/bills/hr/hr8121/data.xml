  <summary date="2020-11-17T18:25:19Z" status="Passed House">Pandemic Effects on Home Safety and Tourism Act

This bill requires studies and reports about the effects of COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) with respect to tourism and consumer product safety.

Specifically, the Consumer Product Safety Commission must report, and make available to the public, information about injuries and deaths from consumer products during the COVID-19 public health emergency. The report must be submitted every three months for the duration of the emergency.

Additionally, the Department of Commerce, in consultation with appropriate stakeholders, must study and report about the effects of the pandemic on the travel and tourism industry. Commerce must consider metrics including changes in employment rate, sales, and business revenue, and it must provide the opportunity for public comment. An interim study and report must be submitted not later than three months after the enactment of this bill.</summary>
