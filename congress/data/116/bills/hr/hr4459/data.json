Limited, Zhongxing Telecommunications Equipment Corporation, or any subsidiary or affiliate of either entity). The Federal Communications Commission must publish and maintain a list of such equipment or services.\n\nIn addition, the bill establishes the Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Reimbursement Program to supply small communications providers (i.e., providers with 2 million or fewer customers) with funds to offset the cost of removing prohibited equipment or services from their networks and replacing it with more secure communications equipment or services."
