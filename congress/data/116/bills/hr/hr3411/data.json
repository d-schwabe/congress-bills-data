    "text": "This bill revises requirements for exemptions given to small refineries of crude oil under the renewable fuel program, which requires transportation fuel to contain a minimum volume of renewable fuel.\n\nSpecifically, the bill requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to determine the overall reduction in the national quantity of renewable fuel as a result of exemptions granted to small refineries in 2006-2018. The EPA must increase the renewable fuel standard (RFS) by adding such reductions to future year RFS obligations."
