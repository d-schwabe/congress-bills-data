This bill temporarily prohibits financial regulators from requiring any person impacted by COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) to comply with the current expected credit loss rule issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board in June 2016. (This rule establishes a credit loss accounting standard based on expected losses rather than incurred losses.)

The prohibition ends six months after the date of enactment.</summary>
