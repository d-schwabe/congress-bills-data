This bill requires the Department of Commerce to study and report on the impact of new and advanced materials, including synthetically derived or enhanced natural properties, on U.S. businesses conducting interstate commerce.

Such study shall involve, among other things, (1) listing industry sectors that develop, use, or rely on new and advanced materials and reviewing uses and potential applications of such materials; (2) establishing a list of federal agencies asserting jurisdiction over such industry sectors; and (3) assessing risks and trends in relevant marketplaces and supply chains that impact new and advanced materials.

Commerce must report to Congress the results of such study and any recommendations to promote the adoption of new and advanced materials.</summary>
