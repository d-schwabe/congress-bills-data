This bill establishes the AI Center of Excellence within the General Services Administration to

 advise and promote the efforts of the federal government in developing innovative uses of artificial intelligence (AI) to benefit the public, and improve cohesion and competency in the use of AI. The Office of Management and Budget must issue a memorandum to federal agencies regarding AI governance approaches, to be followed by preparation and submission of governance plans by the agencies.

In addition, the Office of Personnel Management must

 identify key skills and competencies needed for positions related to AI; and establish an occupational series, or revise an existing job series, to include positions the primary duties of which relate to AI.</summary>
