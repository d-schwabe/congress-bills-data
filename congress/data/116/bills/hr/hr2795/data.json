A corridor means a feature of the landscape or seascape that (1) provides habitat or ecological connectivity, and (2) allows for movement or dispersal of native fish, wildlife, or plants. Indian tribes may nominate a corridor within their land to be included in a Tribal Wildlife Corridor.\n\nIn addition, the bill establishes a Wildlife Corridors Stewardship Fund to receive donations for the management and protection of the corridors.\n\nIt also establishes a wildlife movement grant program to encourage the passage of native fish, wildlife, or plant species across a landscape or seascape. The National Coordination Committee, established by this bill, must recommend projects to fund under the grant program. The committee must also develop standards for regional wildlife movement plans to allow for better cross-regional collaboration. No fewer than four regional wildlife movement councils must be established. Among other things, the councils must submit to the committee regional wildlife movement plans as well as lists of funding priorities.\n\n Finally, the U.S. Geological Survey must establish a National Wildlife Corridors Database."
