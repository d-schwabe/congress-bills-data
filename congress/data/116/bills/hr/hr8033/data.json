Additionally, the VA must consider and implement findings from the assessment of the Government Accountability Office of the responsibilities, workload, and vacancy rates for suicide prevention coordinators.\n\nThe VA must conduct a study to determine the feasibility and advisability of the realignment and reorganization of suicide prevention coordinators within the Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention and the creation of a suicide prevention coordinator program office."
