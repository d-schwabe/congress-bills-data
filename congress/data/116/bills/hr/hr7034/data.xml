This bill extends the deadline for the U.S. Census Bureau to complete the 2020 decennial census of population and related tabulations.

The bill requires the bureau to report specified information, such as (1) the total number of field staff, sorted by category; (2) the anticipated schedule of census operations; and (3) total spending on media, advertisements, and partnership specialists.

An institution of higher education may provide to the bureau information requested for purposes of enumeration for the 2020 decennial census of population.

The bureau may not compile, produce, or publish any data product or tabulation as part of, in combination with, or in connection with the 2020 decennial census of population or any such census data that includes topics specific to the 2020 census that were not part of a report submitted on March 28, 2017, and the 2018 End-to-End Census Test conducted in Providence County, Rhode Island.</summary>
