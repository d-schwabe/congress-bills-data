This bill establishes standards and remedies related to ground-based noise (GBN).

Specifically, the bill

 permits one or more states to conduct studies of GBN from aircraft operations at an airport within a state, requires any study conducted to identify a baseline value of GBN above which an airport in the study is presumed to be permitting an excess of noise to a community within five miles of such airport, allows a state cause of action for GBN if a state has undertaken a study of GBN at an airport, and establishes that no federal statute is intended to preempt a cause of action against an airport in any state small claims or superior court when an action is brought for GBN in violation of state standards.</summary>
