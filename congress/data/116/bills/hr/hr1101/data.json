Additionally, a provider is required to disclose accurate and relevant management practices, performance information, and commercial terms sufficient for consumers to make informed choices and for providers of content, applications, services, and devices to develop and market new internet offerings.\n\nAdditionally, the bill prohibits the FCC or a state commission from relying on their duty to encourage the deployment of advanced telecommunications capability as a grant of authority."
