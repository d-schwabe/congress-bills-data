The notice must include an explanation of the right of the individual to dispute the overpayment or request a waiver of indebtedness.\n\nThe VA must report on its plan for the improvement of the notification and communication processes for individuals who receive overpayments from the VA.\n\nThe bill prohibits interest and administrative cost charges on delinquent payments of debt resulting from a person's participation in a VA disability compensation program, pension program, or an educational assistance program."
