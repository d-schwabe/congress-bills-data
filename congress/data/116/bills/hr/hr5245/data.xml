  <summary date="2019-11-21T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Stopping Harm and Implementing Enhanced Lead-time for Debts for Veterans Act or the SHIELD for Veterans Act

This bill updates debt collection and overpayment processes related to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits or programs.

Specifically, the bill prohibits the VA from collecting all or any part of an amount owed under a VA program if the amount is owed for any payment or overpayment that was caused by the amount of time taken by the VA to process information provided by or on behalf of an individual.

If the VA has made an overpayment to an individual, the VA must provide notice to the individual of the overpayment and any action the VA plans to take to collect repayment or reduce any benefit of the individual at least 90 days before taking such action. The notice must include an explanation of the right of the individual to dispute the overpayment or request a waiver of indebtedness.

The VA must report on its plan for the improvement of the notification and communication processes for individuals who receive overpayments from the VA.

The bill prohibits interest and administrative cost charges on delinquent payments of debt resulting from a person's participation in a VA disability compensation program, pension program, or an educational assistance program.</summary>
