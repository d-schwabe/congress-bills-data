Currently, an IHE must make such a disclosure if the gift or contract is valued at $250,000 or more.\n\nAn IHE must report, if available, the purpose of the gift or contract.\n\nThe bill also requires the Government Accountability Office to study and report on IHEs' compliance with these disclosure requirements."
