    "text": "Refer and Equip Veterans and Military Personnel Act or the REVAMP Act\n\nThis bill revises the Transition Assistance Program, which prepares service members for civilian life.\n\nThe bill extends to certain reservists specified program requirements that currently apply to service members separating from active duty. Specifically, the bill requires certain members of a reserve component who have previously served on active duty to be provided with both a physical examination and a mental health assessment prior to separation. Under current law, only a physical examination must be offered to such reservists, and the examination is optional.\n\nThe bill also specifies the time period during which the pre-separation physical examination and mental health assessment must occur. Specifically, a service member must undergo a physical examination and mental health assessment during the 90-day period before the service member's separation from the Armed Forces.\n\nIn addition, the bill requires pre-separation counseling to include a plan for a service member's achievement of health care objectives."
