  <summary date="2020-05-08T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">COVID-19 Racial and Ethnic Disparities Task Force Act of 2020

This bill establishes the COVID-19 Racial and Ethnic Disparities Task Force within the Department of Health and Human Services and sets forth its&#160;duties and membership. The task force must provide reports and recommendations&#160;related to&#160;racial and ethnic disparities in the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) response to Congress and relevant federal agencies.

First, the task force must report weekly on COVID-19 infections and patient outcomes with data disaggregated by race and ethnicity. The reports must also identify communities with high levels of racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 measures and recommend how to allocate health care and other resources to address these disparities. Second, the task force must report biweekly on the disbursement of federal COVID-19 relief funds and how to use any undisbursed funds&#160;to address racial and ethnic disparities. Lastly, the task force must submit a final report that describes factors that contributed to racial and ethnic disparities with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic, with recommendations to address them in responses to future infectious disease outbreaks.

The task force terminates 90 days after the end of the COVID-19 public health emergency . However, the bill permanently establishes a successor task force to address racial and ethnic disparities during future public health emergencies.</summary>
