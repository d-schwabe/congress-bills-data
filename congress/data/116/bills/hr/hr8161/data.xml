This bill authorizes grants to connect offenders transitioning from prisons or jails to the community with local reentry services.

The Department of Justice (DOJ) may award grants to community-based nonprofits for community reentry centers. The centers must provide comprehensive services tailored to meet the needs of individuals returning to a particular community. These services may include, for example, help with finding employment and applying for public benefits. Additionally, DOJ must evaluate this program.

 DOJ may also award grants to states and localities for toll-free hotlines that direct callers to local reentry services. DOJ must also develop best practices for setting up these hotlines.</summary>
