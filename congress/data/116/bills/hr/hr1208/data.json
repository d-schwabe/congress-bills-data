Currently, U.S. nationals must become a resident of a state to qualify for naturalization.\n\nIndividuals born in an outlying possession are U.S. nationals but do not automatically acquire citizenship through birth in an outlying possession.\n\nThe bill also waives certain naturalization requirements, including those related to English language proficiency and participation in a public ceremony, for individuals who have continuously resided in an outlying possession or state from birth to the approval of a naturalization application.\n\nThe Department of Interior may issue a grant to America Samoa for holding a referendum on whether those born or residing in America Samoa should be declared U.S. citizens."
