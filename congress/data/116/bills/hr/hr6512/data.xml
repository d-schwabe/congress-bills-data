  <summary date="2020-04-14T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Voter Notification of Timely Information about Changes in Elections Act or the Voter Notice Act

This bill requires state and local election officials to conduct public education campaigns in the event of changes to federal elections (e.g., methods of voting) due to public health and safety emergencies.

Specifically, the bill requires election officials to notify individuals of changes to federal elections by (1) providing not fewer than one direct mailing to each registered voter; and (2) notifying individuals who are eligible to vote through direct mailings, newspaper advertisements, broadcasting, and social media.

Election officials must ensure their official public websites are accessible to individuals with disabilities, including the blind and visually impaired.

The bill also directs the National Institute of Standards and Technology to establish and regularly update best practices to ensure official public websites of election officials are continuously operating during emergencies. Election officials must ensure their official public websites comply with such best practices.

 The Election Assistance Commission must make payments to states for conducting public education campaigns and operating election websites during emergencies.</summary>
