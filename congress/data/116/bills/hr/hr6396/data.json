Recipients of such loans are eligible for forgiveness of amounts expended for specified costs such as payroll. Small businesses may request an advance of up $10,000 on an SBA disaster loan for which they have applied in response to COVID-19.\n\nFurther the bill\n\n requires the SBA to temporarily pay the principal, interest, and any associated fees that are owed on certain SBA loans; repeals provisions that require an employer to provide paid sick leave for employees who are unable to work due to COVID-19; repeals provisions authorizing the use of certain funds to provide educational assistance and training for U.S. workers; provides additional time for federal contractors to carry out their responsibilities and guarantees payment continuation for federal contractors who are delayed or interrupted because of COVID-19; increases and expands the tax deduction for certain trade or business income; authorizes borrowers with federally backed mortgages who are experiencing financial hardship due to COVID-19 to request forbearance; revises provisions relating to health savings accounts (HSAs), including to allow increased participation in HSAs and to increase the limit on contributions to HSAs; expands reporting requirements for pharmaceutical manufacturers; and extends the deadline for filing 2019 individual income tax returns from April 15, 2019, to November 15, 2019."
