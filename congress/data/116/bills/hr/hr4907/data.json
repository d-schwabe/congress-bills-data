Each rescue committee may develop recommendations and legislation to improve the program for which it was established, including by (1) increasing the duration of positive balances of the federal trust fund established for the program, and (2) providing for the solvency of the federal trust fund established for the program during a 75-year period.\n\nCongress must use specified expedited legislative procedures to consider legislation that is approved and submitted by the rescue committees."
