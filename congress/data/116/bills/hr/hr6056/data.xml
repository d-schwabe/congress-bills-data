This bill places specific obligations on certain large business entities in the United States.

 Specifically, the bill requires such entities to obtain a charter, and it imposes duties and limitations on such entities, including (1) imposing a duty to create a general public benefit as articulated in&#160;its charter, (2) requiring a director &#160;to balance the pecuniary interests of shareholders with the interests of persons materially affected by the entity, (3) restricting when officers and directors may sell certain securities related to the entity, and (4) requiring shareholder and director approval of&#160;the entity's political expenditures.

The bill also establishes the Office of United States Corporations, which shall have various duties such as reviewing and granting charters for large entities. Further, the bill requires the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue rules governing director elections at U.S. corporations, stipulating that no less than two-fifths of the directors shall be elected by employees.</summary>
