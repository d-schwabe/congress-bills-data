  <summary date="2019-09-19T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Lead-Free Future Act of 2019

This bill addresses lead-based hazards, and their abatement, in residential properties.

Specifically, the bill requires the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to award grants to state and local governments and certain nonprofit organizations for the purpose of evaluating and reducing lead-based hazards in residential properties constructed before 1978. Additionally, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) may award grants to state and local governments to monitor blood lead levels in infants, children, and pregnant women and to educate the public on the risks of lead poisoning.

To be eligible to receive funding from these grant programs and others addressing lead poisoning, a state or local government must have a blood lead reference level (i.e., the minimum concentration of lead at which it is recommended that public health actions be taken) at or below the level used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Applicants must also conduct an environmental investigation to identify environmental sources of lead exposure in residential properties and childcare facilities occupied by a child with an elevated blood lead level.

In addition, HUD, the Department of Agriculture, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and the Department of Veterans Affairs must require alignment with specified federal laws, including those related to lead-risk assessment and lead-hazard remediation, as a condition of eligibility for federal mortgage programs and certain federally supported housing. These agencies must also test and remedy lead hazards in such housing.</summary>
