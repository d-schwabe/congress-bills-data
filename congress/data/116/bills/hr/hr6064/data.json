The bill defines premise plumbing as the water distribution system within the property lines of a property, including all buildings and permanent structures on such property. This term also includes building supply and distribution pipes, fixtures, fittings, water heaters, water-treating and water-using equipment; and all respective joints, connections, devices, and appurtenances."
