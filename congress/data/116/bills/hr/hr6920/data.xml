This bill allows employers to suspend payment of payroll taxes (i.e., employer and employee taxes and self-employment taxes) for the period beginning on the enactment of this bill and ending either 90 days later, or upon the termination of the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) emergency period, whichever is shorter. The bill authorizes transfers to specified Social Security trust funds to cover the loss of revenue to such funds resulting from this payroll tax suspension.</summary>
