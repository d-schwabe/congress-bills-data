This bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity, while providing certain benefits and exemptions to religious providers.

An otherwise qualified religious provider shall be eligible to receive federal financial assistance for a particular service without regard to the provider's religious views or teachings.

Agencies authorized to administer federal financial assistance for the support of adoption and foster care services shall issue final rules within two years of this bill's enactment to create an indirect funding program that delivers such assistance to eligible prospective parents for the purpose of obtaining adoption and foster care services through a qualified private agency that they select.

The bill (1) exempts a church or religious organization from claims of employment discrimination because of sexual orientation or gender identity under specified circumstances; and (2) prohibits sanctions for certain employee speech regarding the employee's religious, political, or moral beliefs in the workplace.

The bill establishes certain anti-bullying policies for public elementary and secondary schools, including cyber bullying.

 Any determination of the tax-exempt status of a charitable organization shall be made without regard to the organization's religious beliefs or practices concerning marriage, family, or sexuality, except insofar as such practices pertain to race or criminal sexual offenses punishable under constitutionally valid federal or state law.</summary>
