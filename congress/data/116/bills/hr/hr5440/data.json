Under the bill, eligible entities include tribally designated housing entities, community-based organizations, and other private entities that meet certain requirements.\n\nEntities must submit an application to receive financial assistance that includes a description of the services they propose to provide, among other elements.\n\nThe bill requires the VA to equitably distribute grants across geographic regions and areas with the most need. Additionally, the VA shall give preference to entities that are experienced in providing post-traumatic stress disorder prevention services.\n\nEntities receiving funding must notify service recipients that funding is wholly or partially from the VA.\n\nThe bill also expands VA patient advocate responsibilities by requiring them to share specified information with a family member who is a caregiver of a veteran."
