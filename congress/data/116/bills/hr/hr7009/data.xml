This bill updates terminology related to the Yellow Ribbon Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) by removing a reference to established charges in consistency with other laws related to the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Under the Yellow Ribbon Program, institutions of higher learning can voluntarily enter into an agreement with the VA to fund tuition and fee expenses that exceed amounts payable under the Post-9/11 GI Bill (and the VA will match the contribution).</summary>
