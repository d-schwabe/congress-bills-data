  <summary date="2019-11-22T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Medicare Orthotics and Prosthetics Patient-Centered Care Act

This bill revises payment rules and establishes several requirements relating to coverage of orthotics and prosthetics under Medicare.

Specifically, the bill requires suppliers of orthotics and prosthetics to meet certain standards with respect to licensure and accreditation, physical facilities, and liability insurance. Orthotists and prosthetists may also issue written orders for commercial purposes that meet specified standards; such orders must be signed by the treating physician.

The bill also prohibits payment under Medicare for certain prosthetics and orthotics that are delivered via drop shipment (i.e., direct shipment to a beneficiary who has not received corresponding patient care from a health care practitioner).</summary>
