    "text": "This bill revises requirements for exemptions given to small refineries of crude oil under the renewable fuel program, which requires transportation fuel to contain a minimum volume of renewable fuel. Specifically, the bill requires the Environmental Protection Agency to ensure that exemptions granted to small refineries do not result in a reduction to the national quantity of renewable fuel required under the program."
