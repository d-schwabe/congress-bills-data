The bill defines state management decision as a state decision to assume full management responsibility for the expenditure of federal funds to advance the educational policy of the state. The duration of a state management decision shall be between 5 and 10 years.\n\nThe state must establish an accountability system that focuses on the academic achievement of students and includes a system (as determined by the state) of evaluating the academic achievement and progress of students."
