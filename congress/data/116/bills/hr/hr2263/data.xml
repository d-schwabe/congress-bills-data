  <summary date="2019-04-10T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Make Education Local Act of 2019

This bill creates a framework under which states may receive federal elementary and secondary education funds on a consolidated basis and use such funds for any educational purpose permitted by state law.

Each state is authorized to submit to the Department of Education a state management decision which, among other things, shall describe how the state will address persistently failing public schools. The bill defines state management decision as a state decision to assume full management responsibility for the expenditure of federal funds to advance the educational policy of the state. The duration of a state management decision shall be between 5 and 10 years.

The state must establish an accountability system that focuses on the academic achievement of students and includes a system (as determined by the state) of evaluating the academic achievement and progress of students.</summary>
