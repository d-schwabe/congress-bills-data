Under the program, Native American tribes or organizations may receive grants to plan for participation in self-governance and to negotiate the terms of participation.\n\nIn addition, the bill revises the Department of the Interior's process for approving self-governance compacts and funding agreements with tribes. Interior must negotiate contracts and funding agreements to maximize implementation of the self-governance policy. The bill sets forth requirements for tribes participating in self-governance with respect to conflicts of interest, audits, redesign and consolidation of programs, retrocession of programs, nonduplication of funding, and records.\n\nFunding agreements must include provisions for Interior to monitor the performance of trust functions by the tribe and to reassume a program and funding under specified circumstances.\n\nTribes participating in self-governance may elect to assume some federal responsibilities with respect to certain construction projects.\n\nThe bill prohibits a tribe from being obligated to continue performance of a compact or funding agreement that provides insufficient funding."
