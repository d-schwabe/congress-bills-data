    "text": "This bill (1) establishes documentation requirements for testing, treatment, and reporting related to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019); and (2) makes it unlawful to knowingly report a false diagnosis of COVID-19. To receive a federal reimbursement for the cost of a COVID-19 diagnostic test or treatment, the request for reimbursement must document that the administered COVID-19 test has been approved, cleared, or authorized by the Food and Drug Administration. Further, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must exclude from its official COVID-19 case and death counts any person who tested positive and requested federal reimbursement without the required documentation. Additionally, any person who knowingly reports a false diagnosis of COVID-19 is subject to criminal fines and imprisonment for not more than 10 years."
