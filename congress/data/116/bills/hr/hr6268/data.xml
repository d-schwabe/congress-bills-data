  <summary date="2020-03-12T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">SBA Business Stabilization Direct Loan Program Act of 2020

This bill requires the Small Business Administration (SBA) to temporarily make loans directly to small businesses located in a U.S. state or territory with a confirmed or presumed positive case of COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019).

A recipient of such a loan may use the funds to, among other things (1) make periodic payments of principal and interest on outstanding SBA loans; (2) provide benefits to employees such as disability insurance, sick leave, and paid family leave; (3) pay wages to employees; or (4) provide employees and patrons with the necessary items specified by a public health authority to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus.

The SBA shall accept any available collateral to secure such a loan and shall not decline to make a loan to an otherwise eligible borrower due solely to inadequate collateral.</summary>
