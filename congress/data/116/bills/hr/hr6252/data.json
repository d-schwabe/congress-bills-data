Specifically, securities offerings are exempt from these registration requirements if (1) the aggregate amount of securities sold to all investors by the issuer is not more than $250,000, (2) the amount sold to any investor by the issuer does not exceed $5,000, and (3) the transaction is conducted through a registered broker or funding portal. This exemption ends three years after the date of enactment.\n\nThe SEC may by rule prohibit a person from engaging in such an offering if the person is\u00a0subject to certain bad-actor or statutory disqualifications.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must report on the impact of this exemption."
