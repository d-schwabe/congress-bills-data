  <summary date="2020-05-19T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Professional Boxing Safety Enhancement Act of 2020

This bill repeals a provision allowing a professional boxing match to meet an alternative requirement in effect under regulations of a boxing commission that provides protection of the health and safety of boxers and that is equivalent to requirements otherwise provided under the Professional Boxing Safety Act of 1996.

A boxer shall provide with the application for a boxing license, or its renewal, an original or certified copy of the results of medical tests that (1) were performed by a laboratory during the calendar year for which the license is being issued or no earlier than 30 days before the application is submitted, and (2) show that the boxer is not infected with the human immunodeficiency virus or the hepatitis virus.

The bill requires an ambulance and emergency medical personnel with appropriate resuscitation equipment (currently, one or the other) to be continuously present on site.</summary>
