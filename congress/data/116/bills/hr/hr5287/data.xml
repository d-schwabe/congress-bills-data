This bill prohibits a debt collector from collecting on federal student loan debt owed by a borrower earning under a certain income. Specifically, a federal student loan debt collector may not attempt to collect if a borrower would qualify for a zero-dollar payment under an income-driven repayment plan. Additionally, a debt collector may not attempt to collect an amount greater than the payment the borrower would owe under such a plan.</summary>
