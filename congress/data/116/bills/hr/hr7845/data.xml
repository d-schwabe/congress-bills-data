This bill requires the Small Business Administration (SBA) to establish a program to make forgivable loans to certain remote recreational businesses that are impacted by border closures due to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019).

Eligible remote recreational businesses must (1) have experienced a loss in revenue that is greater than 50% between March 1, 2020, and July 1, 2020, as compared with the same period in the previous year; and (2) show that the closure of the U.S.-Canada border restricted the ability of American customers to access the location of such business.

The maximum loan amount shall be equal to 75% of the business's FY2019 revenue, and the SBA shall forgive 100% of the value of such loan, less the amount the borrower received from (1) any other loan forgiveness program, and (2) any emergency advance under the economic impact disaster loan program.</summary>
