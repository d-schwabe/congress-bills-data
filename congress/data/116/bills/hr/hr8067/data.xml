  <summary date="2020-08-18T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Addressing COVID-19 Health Disparities Act

This bill requires the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) to research the U.S. health care system's response to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019), including by identifying health care-related factors that contribute to racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 outcomes and strategies to mitigate those factors.

In addition, AHRQ must develop vaccine protocols and strategies in consultation with leaders from populations disproportionately affected by COVID-19 to ensure that such groups have timely access to vaccines.</summary>
