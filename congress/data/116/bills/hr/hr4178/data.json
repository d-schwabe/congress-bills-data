Manufacturers that fail to comply are subject to civil penalties.\n\nThe CMS must determine rebate amounts based on payment claims from providers. (Currently, providers may receive payment under Medicare for discarded amounts of single-dose vial drugs through the use of a specific claims modifier.)"
