The ITA shall then issue a report identifying (1) centers that serve a comparatively high number of SMEs, and (2) locations where a center should be established. Further, the ITA shall implement the changes recommended in such report and may establish up to 30 new centers based on the report.\n\nIn addition, the ITA shall take necessary steps, through actions by the U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service, to increase exports by SMEs."
