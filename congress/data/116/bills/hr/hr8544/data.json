Grant activities include, among others, using data analysis to identify geographic areas with a high prevalence of adverse childhood experiences and to implement strategies to improve outcomes for infants, children, and adolescents.\n\nFor the second program, HHS must award grants to local or tribal governments to establish or expand early childhood trauma-informed care coordination services, including by instituting risk and needs assessments to respond to adverse childhood experiences.\n\nFor both grants, the bill prohibits the use of funds for certain purposes, such as using the data analysis methods to inform individual case decisions, including child removals, or increasing the presence of law enforcement.\n\nIn addition, HHS must evaluate and report on these programs and make findings and recommendations publicly available on its website."
