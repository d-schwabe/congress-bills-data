This bill establishes in the legislative branch the Pandemic Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Commission to make recommendations and propose legislation for modification, consolidation, harmonization, or repeal of regulations that may impede the response to, and recovery from, the effects of the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic and future pandemics.

 The commission must give priority to regulations that (1) were suspended or waived during the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) may impede preparedness or response to a future pandemic; (3) impede or may impede public health, economic performance, or wage and employment stability; and (4) impede or may impede individuals' access to health care, employment, or other supports.

The bill sets forth reporting requirements for the commission and procedures for congressional consideration of commission reports, recommendations, and proposed legislation.</summary>
