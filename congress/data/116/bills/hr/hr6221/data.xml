  <summary date="2020-03-12T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Paid Sick Leave Credit Act of 2020

This bill allows employers a payroll tax credit for required sick leave paid to their employees. The credit is equal to the excess of 90% of sick leave wages paid pursuant to the Emergency Paid Sick Leave Act over the aggregate credits allowed to employers for all prior calendar quarters. The bill limits the amount of wages that may be taken into account for purposes of the credit to $511 for any day an employee is on sick leave and $7,156 in the aggregate for any four consecutive calendar quarters.

The bill requires transfers to specified Social Security trust funds to cover any reduction in revenue due to the tax credit allowed by this bill.</summary>
