    "text": "Protecting America's Wilderness Act\n\nThis bill designates wilderness areas, potential wilderness areas, recreation areas, scenic areas, trails, and wild and scenic rivers in Colorado, California, and Washington, among other things.\n\nTITLE I--COLORADO WILDERNESS\n\nColorado Wilderness Act of 2020\n\n(Sec. 102) The bill designates specified federal lands in Colorado as wilderness and as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System.\n\nIf the Bureau of Reclamation determines that lands within the West Elk Wilderness Addition are necessary for the future expansion of the Blue Mesa Reservoir, the boundary must be revised.\n\nLands within the exterior boundaries of any designated wilderness area that are owned by a private entity or by Colorado are included in the wilderness area if such lands are acquired by the United States. These lands may be acquired only as provided in the Wilderness Act.\n\n(Sec. 103) The grazing of livestock in the wilderness areas designated by this title shall be administered according to certain provisions of the Wilderness Act and the guidelines set forth in a certain House report.\n\nThe Colorado Army National Guard, through the High-Altitude Army National Guard Aviation Training Site, may conduct aerial navigation training maneuver exercises over the potential wilderness areas designated by this bill.\n\nThe Bureau of Land Management (BLM) may continue authorizing competitive running events currently permitted in the Redcloud Peak Wilderness and Handies Peak Wilderness Areas.\n\nFederal land that is traded for privately owned land within the perimeter of the Redcloud Peak Wilderness or the Handies Peak Wilderness Areas shall be located in Hinsdale County, Colorado.\n\nThe bill designates specified lands managed by the BLM as the Pisgah East Wilderness, the Pisgah West Wilderness, or the Flat Tops Wilderness upon publication by the BLM of a notice in the Federal Register that all nonconforming uses of such lands authorized by this bill have ceased.\n\n(Sec. 104) The bill provides for the securing, adjudication, and use of U.S. water rights for certain of the wilderness areas designated by this title.\n\n(Sec. 106) The Department of Defense shall study the impacts that the expansion of wilderness designations in the Western United States would have on the readiness of the Armed Forces with respect to aviation training.\n\nTITLE II--NORTHWEST CALIFORNIA WILDERNESS, RECREATION, AND WORKING FORESTS\n\nNorthwest California Wilderness, Recreation, and Working Forests Act\n\nSubtitle A--Restoration and Economic Development\n\n(Sec. 211) The bill establishes the South Fork Trinity-Mad River Restoration Area, which shall comprise approximately 729,089 acres of federal land administered by the Forest Service and approximately 1,280 acres of federal land administered by the BLM.\n\nIn the restoration area, the agencies\n\n shall prioritize restoration activities, may use prescribed burning and managed wildland fire, and shall decommission identified unneeded National Forest System roads and identified unauthorized roads. The agencies may conduct vegetation management projects in areas of the restoration area only where necessary to, among other things, maintain or restore the characteristics of ecosystem composition and structure. The projects may be (1) in areas in which fish and wildlife habitat is significantly compromised as a result of past management practices (including plantations), and (2) within designated riparian reserves only where necessary to maintain the integrity of fuel breaks and to enhance fire resilience. The agencies must use the best available science in planning and implementing the projects.\n\nThe bill permits the grazing of livestock in the restoration area, where already established, to continue. The agencies may issue annual targeted grazing permits for livestock grazing, where not already established, to control noxious weeds, to aid in the control of wildfire within the wildland-urban interface, or to provide other ecological benefits. The agencies must use the best available science when determining whether to issue such permits.\n\nThe bill withdraws the restoration area from\n\n entry, appropriation, and disposal under the public land laws; location, entry, and patent under the mining laws; and disposition under all laws relating to mineral and geothermal leasing or mineral materials. The agencies shall\n\n use stewardship contracts to implement this section; and use revenue derived from such stewardship contracts for restoration and other activities within the restoration area, including staff and administrative costs to support consultation activities for restoration projects. Collaboratively developed restoration projects within the restoration area may be carried out in accordance with the provisions for hazardous fuel reduction projects under the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003.\n\nThe Forest Service shall\n\n in collaboration with the BLM and interested persons, use a multiparty monitoring, evaluation, and accountability process to assess the positive or negative ecological, social, and economic effects of restoration projects within the restoration area; and incorporate the monitoring results into the management of the restoration area. The agencies may use forest residues from restoration projects, including shaded fuel breaks, in the restoration area for research and development of biobased products that result in net carbon sequestration.\n\n(Sec. 212) The Department of the Interior is authorized to undertake initiatives to restore degraded redwood forest ecosystems in Redwood National and State Parks in partnership with California, local agencies, and nongovernmental organizations.\n\n(Sec. 213) The bill establishes the California Public Lands Remediation Partnership to\n\n coordinate the activities of federal, state, tribal, and local authorities and the private sector in the remediation of high priority lands in California affected by illegal marijuana cultivation or other illegal activities; and use the resources and expertise of each agency, authority, or entity in implementing the activities. The Department of Agriculture (USDA) shall convene the partnership on a regular basis to carry out this section.\n\nUSDA and Interior may provide technical and financial assistance to the partnership or any members of the partnership to carry out this title.\n\n(Sec. 214) The Forest Service may establish a visitor center in Weaverville, California, to serve visitors and to assist in fulfilling the purposes of the Whiskeytown-Shasta-Trinity National Recreation Area. The visitor center must be designed to interpret the resources of the recreation area and other nearby federal lands.\n\n(Sec. 215) USDA and Interior may establish a visitor center in Del Norte County, California, to serve visitors and to assist in fulfilling the purposes of Redwood National and State Parks, the Smith River National Recreation Area, and other nearby federal lands.\n\n(Sec. 216) In revising the land and resource management plan for the Shasta-Trinity, Six Rivers, Klamath, and Mendocino National Forests, the Forest Service shall\n\n consider the purposes of the South Fork Trinity-Mad River Restoration Area, and include or update the fire management plans for the wilderness areas and wilderness additions established by this title. (Sec. 217) Interior shall study the feasibility and suitability of establishing overnight accommodations near the northern and southern boundaries of the Redwood National and State Parks.\n\nIf the study determines that establishing the accommodations is suitable and feasible, Interior may enter into agreements with qualified private and nonprofit organizations for the development, operation, and maintenance of such accommodations.\n\nSubtitle B--Recreation\n\n(Sec. 221) The bill establishes the Horse Mountain Special Management Area, which comprises 7,399 acres of federal land administered by the Forest Service in Humboldt County in California, to enhance the recreational and scenic values of the special management area while conserving the plants, wildlife, and other natural resource values of such area.\n\nThe Forest Service must develop a comprehensive plan for the long-term management of the special management area.\n\nThe management plan shall ensure that recreational use within the special management area does not cause significant adverse impacts on the plants and wildlife of such area.\n\nThe Forest Service shall continue to authorize, maintain, and enhance the recreational use of the special management area.\n\nThe use of motorized vehicles in the special management area shall be permitted only on roads and trails designated for their use, except for the winter use of snowmobiles during periods of adequate snow coverage.\n\nThe Forest Service may construct new trails for motorized or nonmotorized recreation within the special management area. In establishing such trails, the Forest Service shall prioritize the establishment of loops that provide high-quality, diverse recreational experiences.\n\nThe bill withdraws the special management area from\n\n appropriation or disposal under the public land laws; location, entry, and patent under the mining laws; and disposition under laws related to mineral and geothermal leasing. (Sec. 222) USDA, in cooperation with Interior, shall study the feasibility of establishing a nonmotorized Bigfoot National Recreation Trail that shall extend from the Ides Cove Trailhead in the Mendocino National Forest to Crescent City, California.\n\nUpon a determination that the Bigfoot National Recreation Trail is feasible and meets the requirements for a National Recreation Trail, USDA shall then designate the recreation trail in accordance with the National Trails System Act, this title, and other applicable law.\n\nThe bill bars any portion of the trail from being located on nonfederal land without the landowner's written consent.\n\nUSDA must not acquire for the trail any land or interest in land outside of the exterior boundary of any federally managed area without the owner's consent.\n\n(Sec. 223) The Forest Service shall designate an Elk Camp Ridge Recreation Trail, which may include a system of trails, on its land in Del Norte County that is authorized for use by off-highway vehicles, mountain bicycles, or both.\n\nIn order to minimize the impacts of the use of the trail on environmental and cultural resources, the Forest Service shall annually assess the effects of the use of off-highway vehicles and mountain bicycles on the trail, land located in proximity to the trail, plants, wildlife, and wildlife habitat.\n\n(Sec. 224) The Forest Service may construct a recreational trail for nonmotorized uses around Trinity Lake if it determines construction of the trail is feasible and in the public interest.\n\nThe trail may be constructed through the acceptance of volunteer services and contributions from nonfederal sources to reduce or eliminate the need for federal expenditures to construct the trail.\n\n(Sec. 225) The Forest Service shall conduct a study to improve motorized and nonmotorized recreation trail opportunities (including mountain bicycling) on land not designated as wilderness within portions of the Six Rivers, Shasta-Trinity, and Mendocino National Forests located in Del Norte, Humboldt, Trinity, and Mendocino Counties.\n\n(Sec. 226) The Forest Service may construct recreational trails for mountain bicycling and other nonmotorized uses on the routes generally depicted in the report titled Trail Study for Smith River National Recreation Area Six Rivers National Forest and dated 2016, if the Forest Service determines construction is feasible and in the public interest.\n\nThe trail may be constructed through the acceptance of volunteer services and contributions from nonfederal sources to reduce or eliminate the need for federal expenditures to construct the route.\n\n(Sec. 227) Interior or USDA may enter into agreements with qualified private and nonprofit organizations to undertake the following activities on federal lands in Mendocino, Humboldt, Trinity, and Del Norte Counties:\n\n trail and campground maintenance; public education, visitor contracts, and outreach; and visitor center staffing. Subtitle C--Conservation\n\n(Sec. 231) The bill designates certain federal lands in California as wilderness areas and as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System.\n\nThe bill redesignates the North Fork Wilderness as the North Fork Eel River Wilderness.\n\nThe bill adjusts the boundary of the Elkhorn Ridge Wilderness by deleting approximately 30 acres of federal land.\n\n(Sec. 232) The Forest Service and BLM may take measures in such a designated wilderness or wilderness addition as are necessary to control fire, insects, and diseases.\n\nTo ensure a timely and efficient response to fire emergencies in the wilderness additions designated by this subtitle, USDA shall\n\n establish agency approval procedures for responding to fire emergencies, and enter into agreements with state or local firefighting agencies. The grazing of livestock in the wilderness areas and wilderness additions designated by this title, if already established, shall be administered in accordance with the Wilderness Act and specified guidelines.\n\nThe wilderness areas and wilderness additions are withdrawn from\n\n entry, appropriation, and disposal under the public land laws; location, entry, and patent under the mining laws; and operation of the mineral materials and geothermal leasing laws. The agencies must ensure that Indian tribes have access to the wilderness areas and wilderness additions for traditional cultural and religious purposes. One or more specific portions of an area or addition may be temporarily closed to the public to protect the privacy of the members of a tribe when conducting traditional cultural and religious activities there.\n\nAny land within the boundary of a wilderness area or wilderness addition that is acquired by the United States shall become part of the area.\n\nThe agencies may authorize the installation and maintenance of hydrologic, meteorologic, or climatological collection devices in the wilderness areas and wilderness additions if the facilities and access to them are essential to flood warning, flood control, or water reservoir operation activities.\n\nThe Forest Service may continue to authorize the competitive equestrian event permitted since 2012 in the Chinquapin Wilderness in a manner that is compatible with the preservation of such area as wilderness.\n\n(Sec. 233) The bill designates certain federal lands in California as potential wilderness areas.\n\nThe Forest Service or National Park Service, for purposes of ecological restoration, may use motorized equipment and mechanized transport in a potential wilderness area until it is designated as wilderness. The minimum tool or administrative practice necessary shall be used to accomplish ecological restoration with the least amount of adverse impact.\n\nA potential wilderness shall be designated as wilderness and as a component of the National Wilderness Preservation System on the earlier of\n\n when a notice has been published by the managing agency that the conditions in the area that are incompatible with the Wilderness Act have been removed, or it is 10 years after enactment of this bill for areas located on lands managed by the Forest Service. (Sec. 234) The bill designates specified river segments from the source tributaries in the Yolla Bolly-Middle Eel Wilderness as components of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System.\n\n(Sec. 235) The bill establishes the Sanhedrin Special Conservation Management Area, comprising approximately 14,177 acres of federal land administered by the Forest Service in Mendocino County, California.\n\nThe use of motorized vehicles shall be permitted in the conservation management area only on existing roads, trails, and areas designated for use by such vehicles. The bill prohibits the construction of any new or temporary roads within such area.\n\nThe bill prohibits timber harvesting within the conservation management area unless the Forest Service authorizes it as necessary to further the purposes of such area.\n\nLivestock grazing, where already established, shall be permitted to continue in the conservation management area.\n\nThe Forest Service may take any measures within the conservation management area that are necessary to control fire, insects, and diseases.\n\nThe Forest Service may acquire by purchase from willing sellers, donation, or exchange, any land or interest in land within or adjacent to the boundaries of the conservation management area for incorporation into the area.\n\nAll federal lands located within the conservation management area are withdrawn from\n\n entry, appropriation, and disposal under the public land laws; location, entry, and patent under the mining laws; and operation of the mineral leasing, mineral materials, and geothermal leasing laws. Subtitle D--Miscellaneous\n\n(Sec. 242) USDA and Interior shall incorporate the designations and studies required by this title into updated management plans for units covered by this title.\n\nTITLE III--CENTRAL COAST HERITAGE PROTECTION\n\nCentral Coast Heritage Protection Act\n\n(Sec. 303) The bill designates specified lands in California administered by the BLM or the Forest Service as wilderness areas and as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System.\n\n(Sec. 304) The bill designates specified lands, comprising approximately 2,359 acres, as the Machesna Mountain Potential Wilderness.\n\nThe Forest Service may reconstruct, realign, or reroute the Pine Mountain Trail. In carrying out such an activity, the Forest Service shall use the minimum tool or administrative practice necessary to accomplish the reconstruction, realignment, or rerouting with the least amount of adverse impact on wilderness character and resources.\n\nThe Forest Service may permit the use of motorized and mechanized vehicles on the existing Pine Mountain Trail until the potential wilderness area is designated as wilderness.\n\nThe federal lands in the potential wilderness area are withdrawn from\n\n entry, appropriation, or disposal under the public land laws; location, entry, and patent under the mining laws; and disposition under all laws pertaining to mineral and geothermal leasing or mineral materials. The Forest Service shall modify the boundary of the potential wilderness area to exclude any area within 150 feet of the centerline of the new location of any trail that has been reconstructed, realigned, or rerouted.\n\nThe potential wilderness area, as modified, shall be designated as wilderness and as a component of the National Wilderness Preservation System on the earlier of\n\n when the Forest Service publishes a notice in the Federal Register that the reconstruction, realignment, or rerouting of the trail has been completed; or 20 years after enactment of this bill.
