This bill requires the Department of Education to provide assistance to certain family members of elementary or secondary school staff members killed by an act of violence while performing school duties.

Specifically, victims' families shall be provided with (1) funeral assistance; (2) a death benefit payment to the surviving spouse, dependent child, or other next of kin; (3) a monthly living allowance for the surviving spouse until death or remarriage and for each dependent child until age 18; and (4) undergraduate education assistance for each dependent child for five years.
