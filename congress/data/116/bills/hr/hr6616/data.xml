  <summary date="2020-04-24T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Stronger Medicaid Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic Act

This bill allows COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) vaccines and treatment, as well as treatment for conditions that may complicate COVID-19 treatment, for uninsured individuals to be covered under Medicaid during the public health emergency. (Currently, state Medicaid programs have the option to cover COVID-19 testing for uninsured individuals.)

The bill also specifically allows COVID-19 testing, vaccines, and treatment, as well as treatment for complicating conditions, for certain unlawful aliens to be covered under Medicaid during the public health emergency.</summary>
