  <summary date="2019-02-14T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Preserving Teacher Loan Forgiveness for Military Spouses Act of 2019

This bill modifies the qualifying service requirement of the teacher loan forgiveness program for certain military spouses who have student federal loans.

Under current law, an otherwise qualified full-time teacher must complete five consecutive years of service to be eligible for the teacher loan forgiveness program. This bill permits a teacher who completes five full-time years of nonconsecutive service to be eligible for loan forgiveness if the teacher's spouse was relocated by the military.</summary>
