Expensing is the treatment of expenditures as operating costs deductible in full in the current taxable year.\n\nThe bill allows a new tax deduction for 200% of the cost of purchasing or acquiring such critical minerals and metals extracted from deposits in the United States.\n\nThe bill requires the Department of Defense (DOD) to establish a pilot project grant program for the development of critical minerals and metals in the United States. A grant awarded under such program may not exceed $10 million. In awarding grants, DOD must give priority to projects determined to be economically viable over the long term and must allot 30% of grants funds to the secondary recovery of critical minerals and metals."
