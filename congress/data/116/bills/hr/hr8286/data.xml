This bill directs the President to impose asset- and visa-blocking sanctions on foreign individuals and entities engaged in certain acts of malign disinformation.

Specifically, the President shall impose sanctions on an individual or entity that knowingly commits a significant act of malign disinformation on behalf of a foreign government or political party to influence certain activities in the United States for the purpose of harming (1) U.S. national security, or (2) the safety and security of a U.S. citizen or legal permanent resident.

The Department of State shall report to Congress a determination of whether the Chinese Communist Party's United Front Work Department, which engages in disinformation campaigns and other activities, or any of its officials, falls within the sanctions provided under this bill.</summary>
