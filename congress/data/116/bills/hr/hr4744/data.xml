This bill prohibits the use of federal funds for any purpose relating to the 46th G7 Summit and the Trump National Doral Miami in Miami, Florida, unless the Secret Service certifies to Congress that such an expenditure is necessary to provide required protection to a person. (The G7 Summit is a meeting of the seven largest major advanced economies, as determined by the International Monetary Fund.)

The President shall provide to the Government Accountability Office and Congress all documents and communications relating to the decision to host the summit at the Trump National Doral Miami.</summary>
