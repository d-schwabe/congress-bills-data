The volunteer may elect to extend such insurance, at the volunteer's expense, until the last day in which the volunteer would be eligible for unemployment benefits under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act.\n\nExecutive branch departments and agencies with hiring needs, as well as the Corporation for National and Community Service, shall establish expedited processes for hiring and enrolling such terminated Peace Corps volunteers.The Peace Corps shall (1) resume all programs, to the extent possible, as soon as the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided; and (2) establish an expedited process for reenrolling Peace Corps volunteers whose service was terminated due to COVID-19.\n\nFor the purpose of Foreign Service officer appointments, a candidate's previous Peace Corps service shall be considered a significant affirmative factor but shall be less significant than the affirmative factor afforded to a veteran.\n\nThe Peace Corps shall inform exiting volunteers of various health care options available after leaving the Peace Corps.\n\nThe bill allows the official seal or emblem of the Peace Corps and the name Peace Corps to be used on any death announcement, plaque, gravestone, or other grave marker of a former volunteer, officer, or employee."
