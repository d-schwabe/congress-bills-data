  <summary date="2020-05-12T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Utilizing and Supporting Evacuated Peace Corps Volunteers Act

This bill provides benefits for Peace Corps volunteers, including health insurance for volunteers whose service was terminated due to the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) outbreak.

Such a terminated Peace Corps volunteer shall receive health insurance for two months upon return to the United States. The volunteer may elect to extend such insurance, at the volunteer's expense, until the last day in which the volunteer would be eligible for unemployment benefits under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act.

Executive branch departments and agencies with hiring needs, as well as the Corporation for National and Community Service, shall establish expedited processes for hiring and enrolling such terminated Peace Corps volunteers.The Peace Corps shall (1) resume all programs, to the extent possible, as soon as the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided; and (2) establish an expedited process for reenrolling Peace Corps volunteers whose service was terminated due to COVID-19.

For the purpose of Foreign Service officer appointments, a candidate's previous Peace Corps service shall be considered a significant affirmative factor but shall be less significant than the affirmative factor afforded to a veteran.

The Peace Corps shall inform exiting volunteers of various health care options available after leaving the Peace Corps.

The bill allows the official seal or emblem of the Peace Corps and the name Peace Corps to be used on any death announcement, plaque, gravestone, or other grave marker of a former volunteer, officer, or employee.</summary>
