This bill requires that 70% of chief-of-mission appointments and assignments in the Foreign Service shall be of career members of the Foreign Service or the Department of State civil service. The President may waive this requirement on a case-by-case basis by certifying to Congress that a reduction of this percentage is vital to U.S. national security interests.</summary>
