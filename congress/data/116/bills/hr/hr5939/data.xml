This bill requires research and education activities related to triple-negative breast cancer. (The cells of these breast cancers are negative for estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, and excess HER2 protein.)

The National Institutes of Health must conduct and support research into the disease, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Health Resources and Services Administration must develop and disseminate information about triple-negative breast cancer for the public and for health care providers, respectively. Among other topics, the information must cover the elevated risk for minority women and the availability of a range of treatment options for such cancers.</summary>
