If an affected county makes a recommendation to deny the petition, then Interior may not approve the petition.\n\nA person in a state with an approved petition may take a gray wolf that is attacking a stock animal or dog if the person (1) is not trespassing or on land administered by the National Park Service; and (2) did not intentionally bait, feed, or otherwise attract the wolf."
