  <summary date="2019-02-28T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill requires each federal agency, for the purposes of booking and making payments for traveling employees' lodging expenses, to give priority to preferred places of accommodation.

To be considered a preferred place of accommodation, a hotel, motel, or other place of public accommodation must have certain measures in place, including (1) a zero-tolerance policy regarding severe forms of trafficking in persons, (2) procedures for employees to identify and report such exploitation to appropriate law enforcement authorities and to hotel management, and (3) certain mandatory training for employees who are located at the place of accommodation and who are likely to interact with guests.

The General Services Administration shall (1) develop and make available a model zero-tolerance policy for places of accommodation, (2) develop and publish a list of training programs that address the identification of human trafficking and reporting to authorities, and (3) maintain a list of each preferred place of accommodation.

Compliance with these requirements shall be assessed and enforced separately for each individual place of accommodation, and a lack of compliance by one shall not impact the eligibility of an affiliated establishment.</summary>
