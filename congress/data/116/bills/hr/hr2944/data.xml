This bill authorizes the Department of Defense (DOD) to establish a program to temporarily assign a member of the acquisition workforce to a private-sector organization or an employee of such an organization to DOD. Such an arrangement would require the consent of the individual who is assigned, extend for a period no more than two years, and be renewable to a total of four years.

 A member of the acquisition workforce who is assigned to a private-sector organization shall be considered to be on detail to a regular assignment in DOD. The agreement will address specific terms related to continued status as a federal employee, as well as&#8212;for nine-month or longer assignments&#8212;eligibility for placement in a new position allowing priority placement.

DOD shall consider how assignments under this bill might best be used to help meet its needs concerning training of the acquisition workforce.</summary>
