This bill requires the National Park Service (NPS) to prioritize the funds made available under the federal lands transportation program for high-commuter corridors. (A high-commuter corridor is a federal lands transportation facility administered by the NPS that has average annual daily traffic of not less than 20,000 vehicles.)

If the NPS determines that a high-commuter corridor requires additional investment it must submit to the state

 information on the condition of pavements and bridges; an estimate of the amounts needed to bring such corridor into a state of good repair, taking into consideration any planned future investments; and at its discretion, a request that the state transfer to the NPS a portion of the amounts necessary to address the condition of the corridor. The bill sets forth the criteria the NPS must consider when making a determination of whether a a high-commuter corridor requires additional investment.</summary>
