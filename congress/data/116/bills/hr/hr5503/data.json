(A high-commuter corridor is a federal lands transportation facility administered by the NPS that has average annual daily traffic of not less than 20,000 vehicles.)\n\nIf the NPS determines that a high-commuter corridor requires additional investment it must submit to the state\n\n information on the condition of pavements and bridges; an estimate of the amounts needed to bring such corridor into a state of good repair, taking into consideration any planned future investments; and at its discretion, a request that the state transfer to the NPS a portion of the amounts necessary to address the condition of the corridor. The bill sets forth the criteria the NPS must consider when making a determination of whether a a high-commuter corridor requires additional investment."
