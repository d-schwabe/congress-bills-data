  <summary date="2020-06-15T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This resolution expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that the United States can achieve a more perfect union

 through avoidance of government speech (as the state of Texas did in Walker III v. Texas Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans, Inc.) that promotes or displays symbols, signs, and vestiges of racism, oppression, and intimidation; by abating the use of government speech through signs, actions, and words that promote division and tear at the fabric of American society; and by taking actions to ensure that government speech does not foster division, disharmony, or intolerance through government-issued or sponsored flags, signs, images, or other symbols.</summary>
