  <summary date="2019-11-26T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This resolution acknowledges the maternal health crisis disproportionately affecting American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian women that has led to high rates of maternal mortality and morbidity.

The resolution calls for urgent funding increases for the Indian Health Service, Tribally Operated Health Centers, Urban Indian Organizations, and Native Hawaiian health care programs to improve access to high-quality maternal health, prenatal care, and family planning services.

Additionally, the resolution recognizes the federal government's failure to uphold tribal treaty rights pertaining to the provision of adequate health care services to American Indians and Alaska Natives.

Finally, the resolution calls for the prioritization of policy for American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian women to reduce long-standing barriers to maternal health and family planning services.</summary>
