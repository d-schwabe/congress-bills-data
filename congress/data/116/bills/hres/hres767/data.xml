      <text>POINT OF ORDER - Mr. Scalise rose to raise a point of order against H.Res. 767 on the ground that the report accompanying the resolution fails to specify the waiver of a particular point of order, and is thus in violation of clause 6(g) of rule 13. The Chair advised the gentleman that he was not stating a proper point of order.</text>

 The resolution (1) designates certain individuals to be admitted to the Hall of the House of Representatives, during consideration of H.Res. 755; (2) after adoption of H.Res. 755, makes it in order to consider in the House a resolution appointing and authorizing managers for the impeachment trial, if offered by the chair of the House Committee on the Judiciary; and (3) prohibits any other resolution incidental to impeachment relating to H.Res. 755 from being privileged during the remainder of the 116th Congress.

The chair of the Committee on the Judiciary may insert in the Congressional Record, within five legislative days after its adoption, such materials as the chair may deem explanatory of (1) H.Res. 755, and (2) the resolution appointing and authorizing managers for the impeachment trial.</summary>
