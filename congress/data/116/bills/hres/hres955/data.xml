 The resolution (1) condemns the decisions of state and local leaders who issued orders imposing economic restrictions based on views of which businesses and activities are essential and which are not, (2) calls on Attorney General William Barr to review all restricting orders issued by such leaders and to act against those that infringe on Americans' constitutional or statutory protections, and (3) calls upon states to restore liberty and responsibility.</summary>
