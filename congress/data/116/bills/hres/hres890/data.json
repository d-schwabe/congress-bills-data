A member who casts such a vote using the remote voting system shall be treated as present for purposes of determining the existence of a quorum for considering the motion.\n\nEach House committee must permit its absent committee members or other participants in the committee's hearing to use video conferencing and related technologies in order to participate in the hearing to the same extent as members of the committee and other participants who are present at the site of the meeting. A committee must adopt a rule under which a member who participates in a hearing remotely shall be included in determining the number of members constituting a quorum at the hearing."
