Further, it expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that (1) the United States and the international community should support the ceasefire and work to ensure humanitarian assistance to Syrian refugees and vulnerable populations in Syria, and (2) Syria should seek a political solution that promotes a road map for peace in the country.</summary>
