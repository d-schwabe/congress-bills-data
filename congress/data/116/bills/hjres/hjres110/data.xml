This joint resolution provides continuing FY2021 appropriations to federal agencies through December 21, 2020. It is known as a continuing resolution (CR) and prevents a government shutdown that would otherwise occur if the FY2021 appropriations bills have not been enacted when the existing CR expires on December 20, 2020.</summary>
