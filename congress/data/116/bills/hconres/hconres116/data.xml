  <summary date="2020-09-16T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This concurrent resolution sets forth considerations for Congress in guiding the national artificial intelligence strategy.

Specifically, the resolution, among other things, expresses the sense of Congress that

 the United States should take a global leadership role in artificial intelligence; the federal government should increase funding for existing technology education programs; the United States should leverage its alliances to promote democratic principles, foster research collaboration, and develop common standards with respect to artificial intelligence; and the federal government should increase investments in artificial intelligence research and development and related fields.</summary>
