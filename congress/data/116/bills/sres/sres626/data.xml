  <summary date="2020-06-17T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This resolution condemns bigotry and acts of violence or discrimination against Iranian Americans and others.

The resolution, among other things

 encourages U.S. elected officials to engage Iranian Americans to share their experiences with their communities to end stereotypes, correct misconceptions, and convey instances of abuse against the Iranian American community; calls upon law enforcement authorities to investigate and vigorously prosecute crimes committed against Americans that are based on actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, or ethnicity; urges the Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties in the Department of Homeland Security to conclude a thorough and timely investigation into detentions of Iranian Americans at the border; and calls on Customs and Border Protection to immediately halt any orders that encourage discrimination on the basis of nationality or religion, including those targeting individuals of Iranian heritage.</summary>
