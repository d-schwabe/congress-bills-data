This bill directs the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to study issues related to health insurance and other coverage for assistive technologies, such as prosthetic devices and custom orthoses, for those who experience amputations or live with a limb difference.

In conducting this study, the GAO must include comparisons of claims and other data from Medicare, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and commercial health insurers.</summary>
