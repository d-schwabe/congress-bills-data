This bill requires the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) to report to Congress about the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi and imposes related sanctions.

The report shall present evidence about whether any current or former government official of Saudi Arabia had advanced knowledge of the killing, ordered the killing, or was involved in tampering with related evidence.

It shall also list foreign persons that the ODNI has high confidence were&#160;responsible for Khashoggi's death, materially assisted in causing the&#160;death, or impeded any investigations into the death. The Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security shall bar such foreign persons from entering the United States and revoke visas belonging to such persons.

The State Department shall report to Congress about the extent to which Saudi Arabia is responsible for gross violations of internationally recognized human rights and about&#160;U.S. actions to address such violations. The report shall also describe the publication by&#160;Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Education of intolerant educational materials and U.S. actions to encourage an end&#160;to the production and use of such materials.</summary>
