  <summary date="2020-07-28T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Safeguarding Americans from Coronavirus and Religious Exercise Discrimination Act or the SACRED Act

This bill makes a state or local jurisdiction that discriminates against religious individuals or religious institutions ineligible to receive or use funds allocated, appropriated, or authorized to address COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019).

Specifically, a state or local jurisdiction violates this bill's prohibition if it (1) enforces, or announces the intent to enforce, any law, regulation, policy, order, proclamation, or decree related to COVID-19 that discriminates against religious individuals or religious institutions; or (2) provides, or shows an intention to provide, funds to a separate jurisdiction that is ineligible to receive or use those funds because the jurisdiction has committed a violation.

The Department of Justice shall determine whether a state or local jurisdiction is ineligible to receive or use such funds.</summary>
