This bill establishes an America Forward Commission to create a strategy to reopen the economy in light of the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic.

Specifically, the commission shall take steps that include

 examining the tools and techniques necessary to ensure that federal, state, and local governments can diagnose, isolate, and mitigate the public health and economic impacts of COVID-19; evaluating information-sharing policies and practices for essential information between government stakeholders; developing recommendations concerning necessary materials; evaluating proposals to strengthen the resilience of economic sectors and protect workers who are most vulnerable to disruption from viral pandemics; and advising on best practices for strengthening international trade, business, and tourism in a manner that reduces the risk of foreign traveler-related transmission of viral disease. The bill requires (1) the commission to submit its findings or recommendations to the White House Coronavirus Task Force and Congress and make them available to the public, and (2) the task force to respond in writing to the commission's recommendations or findings and make its response available to the public.</summary>
