This bill directs the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to conduct surveys and data analysis to collect agricultural subsector-specific information and data regarding (1) the prevention, reduction, and mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions, including livestock emissions reductions; (2) soil carbon sequestration; and (3) forest wood and tree carbon sequestration.

Additionally, the establishment of federal agricultural baselines for the prevention, reduction, and mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions, soil carbon sequestration, and forest wood and tree carbon sequestration must be determined by modeling based on the information and data collected by USDA.

USDA must submit to the Environmental Protection Agency and other appropriate federal agencies, and make publicly available, the results of the surveys.</summary>
