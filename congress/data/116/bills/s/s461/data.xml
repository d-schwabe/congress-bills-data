  <summary date="2020-12-07T16:39:17Z" status="Passed House">HBCU Propelling Agency Relationships Towards a New Era of Results for Students Act or the HBCU PARTNERS Act

This bill addresses the capacity of historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) to participate in federal programs. Specifically, the bill requires certain agencies to submit annual plans for strengthening the capacity of HBCUs to participate in federal programs. Among other things, the plans must establish how the agencies intend to increase the capacity of HBCUs to compete effectively for grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements.

The agencies must provide technical assistance and information to the initiative to enhance communication with HBCUs concerning their program activities and initiatives as well as applications for grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements.

In addition, the bill provides statutory authority for the President's Board of Advisors on HBCUs.</summary>
