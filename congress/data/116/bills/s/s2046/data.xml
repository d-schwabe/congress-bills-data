This bill directs the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), under the State Homeland Security Grant Program, to require each state to include in its grant application a certification for the protection of health care benefits for retired public safety officers. A public safety officer is a law enforcement officer, firefighter, or an emergency medical services provider whose conditions of employment are determined by a collective bargaining agreement.

Such certification must provide that the state will not (1) unilaterally modify or eliminate health care benefits for a public safety officer retiree, or (2) allocate grant funds to a local government or Indian tribe that has not certified to the state that such benefits will not be unilaterally modified or eliminated.</summary>
