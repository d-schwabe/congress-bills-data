Specifically, it requires identification of regulatory standards that an agency determines may inhibit economic recovery from the pandemic and allows the rescission, modification, waiver, or exemption from the standards.

Additionally, agencies may waive notice and comment requirements for rulemaking and exercise discretion in regulatory enforcement, among other modifications to administrative procedures.</summary>
