The office shall (1) perform centralized security reviews and complete security processes for approved research sponsored outside the VA, (2) develop and maintain a list of commercially available software preferred for use in sponsored clinical trials of the VA, (3) ensure such software list is maintained as part of the official approved software products list, and (4) develop benchmarks for time lines for security reviews."
