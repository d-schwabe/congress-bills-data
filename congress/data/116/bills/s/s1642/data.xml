This bill directs the Department of Education (ED) to award grants to partnerships between educational agencies and graduate institutions&#160;to increase the number of school-based mental-health services providers employed by low-income local educational agencies (LEAs).

Grant funds may be used for specified purposes, including to provide student-loan forgiveness and tuition credits and to support recruitment, hiring, and training.

In addition, ED shall establish a program to provide student-loan forgiveness for individuals who (1)&#160;are not, and have never been, participants in the grant program established by the bill; and (2) have been employed by low-income&#160;LEAs&#160;for five or more consecutive school years as mental-health services providers.</summary>
