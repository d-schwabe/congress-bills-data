  <summary date="2019-06-05T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Furthering Access and Networks for Sports Act 

This bill&#160;makes the antitrust laws&#160;applicable to joint agreements among professional football, baseball, basketball, or hockey teams covering the telecasting of sports contests to the extent that a league of clubs does not (1) expressly prohibit sponsored telecast licensees and any video licensee from intentionally removing the live content of such league from a multichannel video programming distributor during, or related to a negotiation regarding, carriage of the league's games by such distributor; or (2) make a sponsored telecast of a game that is played in the home territory of a member club available to consumers over the internet in any territory in which the game is not available for private viewing through a local television broadcast station or a such a distributor.

The bill repeals the exception that allows the antitrust exemption for such a joint agreement that prohibits televising games within the home territory of a member club on a day when such club is playing at home.</summary>
