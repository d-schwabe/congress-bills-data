This bill requires an intercollegiate athletic association to establish a policy that permits a student athlete to earn compensation from a third party for the use of the name, image, or likeness of the athlete and to obtain professional representation with respect to such compensation.

An association must establish rules and programs to administer such policy, including reporting requirements for such compensation and necessary measures to preserve the amateur status of student athletes.</summary>
