This bill addresses the implementation of various aviation safety recommendations.

Among other requirements, the bill directs the Federal Aviation Administration to

 require the manufacturer of the 737 MAX aircraft to demonstrate that system safety assessments for such aircraft consider the effect of all possible flight deck alerts and indications on pilot recognition and response; issue guidance defining pilot monitoring metrics that air carriers may use to train and evaluate pilots, including metrics or measurable tasks that air carriers can use to evaluate pilot monitoring proficiency; direct design and production organizations for aviation products to establish safety management systems that are consistent with the standards of the International Civil Aviation Organization; and create a Center for Excellence dedicated to studying flight automation and human factors in commercial aircraft.</summary>
