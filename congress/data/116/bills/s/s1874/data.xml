This bill revises and sets forth provisions related to the procurement of lighting systems.

The General Services Administration (GSA) shall (1) issue guidance to federal agencies for the procurement and use of the most life-cycle cost effective and energy efficient lighting systems; and (2) publish or otherwise make available to state, local, and tribal entities information on ways of improving efficiency, effectiveness, and economy by procuring and using such lighting systems.

The GSA must (1) procure the most life-cycle cost effective and energy efficient lighting systems, and (2) ensure that procurements of lighting systems or their individual components maximize life-cycle cost effectiveness and energy efficiency.

Each public building that is constructed, altered, acquired, or leased by GSA must be equipped with the most life-cycle cost effective and energy efficient lighting systems. Each individual component of a lighting system that is replaced in the normal course of the maintenance of public buildings shall be replaced with the most life-cycle cost effective and energy efficient lighting system possible.

The bill modifies requirements for the use of energy efficient lighting systems.</summary>
