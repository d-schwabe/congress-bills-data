This bill requires the Department of Commerce to establish the Office of Internet Connectivity and Growth within the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA).

The office&#160;shall connect with communities that need access to high-speed internet and hold regional workshops to share best practices and effective strategies for promoting broadband access and adoption. The bill also requires the office to (1) develop targeted broadband training and presentations for various demographic communities through media; (2) develop and distribute publications providing guidance to communities for expanding broadband access and adoption; and (3) cooperate with state agencies that provide similar investments, outreach, and coordination through federal programs.

The NTIA shall assign its similar activities to the office, and the office shall consult with any agency offering a federal broadband support program in order to streamline the application process for financial assistance or grants.</summary>
