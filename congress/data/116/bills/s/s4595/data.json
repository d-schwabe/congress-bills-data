    "text": "This bill provides an automatic extension for certain J-1 (exchange visitor) visas if the visa holder has a contract or employment agreement with the U.S. Agency for Global Media, the agency that operates U.S. government media outlets such as Voice of America and Radio Free Asia.\n\nSpecifically, if such a J-1 visa expires during the two-month period before this bill's enactment or the 90-day period after, the visa shall remain valid until the end of the 90-day period. The Department of Homeland Security may deny an extension on a case-by-case basis if it (1) determines that extending a particular visa would pose a national security risk, and (2) explains the reasons for the determination to Congress."
