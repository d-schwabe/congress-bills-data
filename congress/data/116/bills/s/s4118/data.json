The bill also requires the Department of the Treasury to remit all U.S.-assessed contributions to the World Health Organization.\n\nThe envoy must develop and implement a diplomatic strategy that addresses, among other things (1) the development of medical countermeasures for emerging infectious diseases; (2) zoonotic (animal-to-human transmission) disease prevention, detection, and response; (3) the development of disease surveillance systems; and (4) efforts to combat the spread of disinformation and discrimination related to the outbreak and spread of infectious disease.\n\nThe envoy shall regularly convene (1) an interagency steering committee to aid in the development, coordination, and implementation of this strategy; and (2) an outside panel of experts to advise on scientific, technical, and policy matters and to make recommendations for the diplomatic strategy."
