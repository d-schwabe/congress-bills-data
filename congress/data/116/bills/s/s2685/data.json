    "text": "Consumer Credit Control Act of 2019 \n\nThis bill requires a consumer's affirmative informed consent before a consumer reporting agency may share that consumer's report with third parties for specified purposes. A consumer reporting agency must verify a consumer's identity when obtaining this consent. (Currently, this sharing is generally allowed unless a consumer opts out.)\n\nIf the consumer provides consent, a consumer reporting agency may share information with a third party for\n\n an extension of credit, or the underwriting of insurance. A consumer reporting agency may provide a consumer report in connection with transactions not initiated by the consumer only if\n\n the consumer provides affirmative consent, and the transaction consists of a firm offer of credit or insurance. The Government Accountability Office must report on how best to protect information collected in consumer files.\n\nConsumer reporting agencies may not charge consumers fees in connection with furnishing consumer reports.\n\nThe bill requires consumer reporting agencies to use reasonable efforts to prevent data breaches of consumer reports."
