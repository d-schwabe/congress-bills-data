  <summary date="2019-03-12T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Native American Indian Education Act

 This bill requires the Department of Education to pay Native American Indian-serving, nontribal institutions of higher education (IHEs) the tuition of their out-of-state Native American Indian students.

The bill applies only to IHEs that are required to provide tuition-free education, with the support of their state, to Native American Indian students as a condition under which the IHE or state received its original grant of land and facilities from the federal government.

Payments are treated as reimbursements to IHEs from their states.</summary>
