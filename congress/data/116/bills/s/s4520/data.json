For the purposes of procurement programs for small businesses owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans, the SBA must certify the status of such businesses, require their periodic recertification, and penalize any small business that misrepresents its status. Accordingly, the bill also abolishes the Center for Verification and Evaluation of the VA and transfers all of its functions to the SBA."
