This bill removes offenses involving the use, possession, or distribution of marijuana from the list of crimes that could render an alien inadmissible into the United States or deportable. An alien previously denied a visa for such marijuana-related activities may reapply for a visa, and an alien previously deported for such activities shall be readmitted into the United States if not otherwise inadmissible.</summary>
