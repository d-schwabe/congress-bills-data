This bill requires the Department of State and the President to report on any agreement with Taliban officials and the peace process in Afghanistan.

Specifically, the bill requires the State Department to submit to Congress any agreement with Taliban officials related to counterterrorism assurances by the Taliban, U.S. troop withdrawals from Afghanistan, and the status of intra-Afghan negotiations and a comprehensive cease-fire.

Following the finalization of an agreement with Taliban officials, the State Department must report on Taliban officials' compliance with obligations and commitments under the agreement, whether Taliban officials and the Haqqani Network have broken ties with&#160;Al Qaeda, the viability of the intra-Afghan governing agreement, and whether the terms of the cease-fire are being met by all sides in the conflict. In addition, the President must submit a biannual report assessing whether key tenets of such agreement with Taliban officials are preserved and honored.</summary>
