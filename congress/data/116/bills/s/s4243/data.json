The minor shall be eligible for nonimmigrant status, either dependent on the parent's status or otherwise, until a decision has been made on the minor's application for lawful permanent resident status.\n\nSuch a minor shall also qualify as a derivative beneficiary child for immigrant visa purposes starting from the approval of the parent's employment-based immigration petition until a decision has been made on the minor's application for permanent resident status, even if the parent is deceased.\n\nThese protections shall not apply if DHS determines that the minor poses a threat to public safety or national security."
