Public notice must be provided after any systematic removal of names.\n\nThe bill provides conditions for the removal of names from an official list of eligible voters. A state is prohibited from removing a name unless the state verifies that the registrant is ineligible to vote. A state is prohibited from considering failure to vote in an election or failure to respond to a notice as evidence of ineligibility to vote."
