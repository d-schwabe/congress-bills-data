In prohibiting such practices, the FTC must consider whether the practice (1) involves goods or services explicitly advertised as related to the COVID-19 emergency, (2) involves goods or services for which consumer demand significantly increased shortly before or during the emergency, or (3) relates to the federal or state response to the emergency. The bill further specifies procedures for the FTC and the states to enforce such prohibitions."
