This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to publish a report at least every 10 years that contains physical-activity recommendations for the general public based on the most current scientific and medical knowledge, including information for population subgroups as needed.

HHS must publish updated reports that detail evidence-based practices and highlight continuing physical-activity issues between the publications of full reports. Updated reports may focus on particular population subgroups or issues relating to physical activity.

A federal agency that proposes to issue physical-activity recommendations that differ from the recommendations in the most recent full report must consider the recommendations in reports issued under this bill.</summary>
