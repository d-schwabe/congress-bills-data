  <summary date="2020-10-21T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill limits the application of a June 22, 2020, presidential proclamation that suspended the entry of certain classes of aliens.

Specifically, if an alien is entering the United States on a J-1 visa to provide childcare for a member of the Armed Forces through an au pair program, the proclamation shall not bar such an alien's entry unless the Department of Homeland Security, Department of Defense, and Department of State jointly issue a written justification for the bar.</summary>
