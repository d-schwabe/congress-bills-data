This bill requires the Department of Labor to establish demonstration and pilot projects, through the awarding of grants or contracts, to facilitate training and education in advanced manufacturing.

A local educational entity (e.g., technical college, community college, or an entity that assists educationally underserved communities) in partnership with a manufacturer that employs individuals who have advanced manufacturing skills is eligible to receive such grants or contracts. The corresponding project must (1) develop skills and competencies in communities with expected growth in advanced manufacturing; (2) provide education and training for available and anticipated jobs in advanced manufacturing; (3) educate individuals about career advancement opportunities within advanced manufacturing; and (4) give priority to incumbent workers, dislocated workers, and unemployed individuals.</summary>
