This bill directs financial regulators&#8212;including the Federal Reserve Board, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the National Credit Union Administration&#8212;to issue guidance relating to a government shutdown. Among other things, financial regulators must issue guidance encouraging financial institutions

 to modify loan terms and to extend credit to consumers and businesses affected by a shutdown, and to take steps to prevent the reporting of adverse credit information related to a shutdown. Financial regulators must also notify the public of this guidance in the event of a government shutdown, and complete a report after a government shutdown regarding the guidance's effectiveness.</summary>
