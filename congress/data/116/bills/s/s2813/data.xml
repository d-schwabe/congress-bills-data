This bill requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to take certain actions to improve hiring and retention of U.S. Customs and Border Protection personnel.

Specifically, DHS must (1) establish a council to develop initiatives for improving hiring and retention efforts; and (2) implement pilot programs, based on council initiatives and other relevant information, at least annually over the course of a five-year period. DHS must implement programs that focus on ports of entry or other duty stations, as well as U.S. Border Patrol duty locations, with severe workforce shortages, critical hiring needs, or retention challenges.</summary>
