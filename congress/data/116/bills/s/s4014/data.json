To be eligible for a supplemental paycheck protection loan, such small business must demonstrate a loss of revenue of 50% or more and have either already expended an initial paycheck protection loan or be on pace to exhaust such loan prior to disbursal of the supplemental loan.\n\nThe bill also extends the application deadline for an initial paycheck protection loan to December 31, 2020, and it authorizes loan recipients to apply for forgiveness as early as eight weeks after the loan's disbursal.\n\nThe Small Business Administration must (1) issue guidance instructing lenders of paycheck protection loans to prioritize loan processing for and disbursement to underserved businesses, (2) update the loan application for paycheck protection loans to collect borrowers' demographic information, and (3) publish specified program information on its website."
