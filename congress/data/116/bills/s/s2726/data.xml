This bill allows certain personal use services to be considered as campaign committee expenditures, including child care, elder care, and health insurance, if the services are necessary to enable a candidate to participate in campaign-connected activities. The amount a committee may pay a candidate as salary is reduced by the amount paid for child care and elder care.</summary>
