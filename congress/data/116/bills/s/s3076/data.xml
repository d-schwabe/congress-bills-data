  <summary date="2020-01-06T13:48:48Z" status="Passed Senate">This bill releases certain reversionary interest in land to Tennessee and adds additional lands to the Rough Mountain Wilderness and the Rich Hole Wilderness in Virginia.

(Sec. 1) Upon the transfer of ownership of the approximately 0.90-acre parcel of land identified as the Webb property to Tennessee for inclusion in the Chickasaw State Forest and the transfer of the approximately 0.62-acre parcel of land identified as state forest land to Tennessee or a non-state entity, the Department of Agriculture (USDA) shall release to Tennessee the reversionary interest of the United States in the state forest land that requires the land to be used for public purposes.

After such actions, USDA shall offer to sell to Tennessee the undivided mineral interests of the United States in the state forest land.

(Sec. 2) The bill adds specified lands in the George Washington National Forest to the Rough Mountain Wilderness and the Rich Hole Wilderness. Until the additional land is incorporated into the Rich Hole Wilderness, USDA may use motorized equipment and mechanized transport in the addition for activities to improve water quality and aquatic passage.</summary>
