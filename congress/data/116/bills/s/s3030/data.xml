This bill creates several grant programs to prevent at-risk tenants from being evicted and&#160;establishes consumer protections related to evictions.

Specifically, the bill

 requires the Department of Justice to establish a grant program for states and local jurisdictions to support landlord-tenant focused community courts that&#160;make&#160;social-service representatives available to assist tenants in becoming current on any debts owed to the landlord or in transitioning to a new, stable home environment; requires the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to&#160;award grants for states and local and tribal governments to establish crisis-assistance programs to prevent extremely low-income households from experiencing housing instability during periods of crisis; and requires HUD to establish a grant program for local governments and nonprofit organizations to collect data from landlords on illegal evictions. The Government Accountability Office must study evictions and report to Congress on the grants awarded under the bill, including best estimates of any amounts saved and any additional revenues generated.

Additionally, HUD must establish and maintain a database of data regarding various forms of eviction.

A tenant who is denied rental housing on the basis of information in a consumer report&#160;must be notified of&#160;such adverse action.&#160;Further, a copy of any consumer report generated in connection with an application for tenancy in rental housing must be given to the consumer. Eviction judgments and related suits where a judgment is rendered in favor of the tenant may not&#160;be included in any consumer reports.</summary>
