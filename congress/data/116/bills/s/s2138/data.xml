This bill eliminates or reduces fees on Small Business Administration (SBA) small-dollar loans for borrowers and certain lenders.

Specifically, in years when the SBA projects its loan programs will operate at a surplus, the SBA must waive or reduce to the maximum extent possible (1) guarantee and yearly fees on all loans to small-dollar borrowers; (2) guarantee fees on express loans to veterans; and (3) if funds allow, fees for lenders making express loans to veterans.

The Congressional Budget Office shall submit an estimate of the cost of providing such fee waivers or reductions.</summary>
