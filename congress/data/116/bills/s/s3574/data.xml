  <summary date="2020-03-24T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Ending Price-Gouging During Emergencies Act This bill makes it unlawful for any person to sell or offer for sale a designated consumer good or service during a public health emergency at a price that (1) is unconscionably excessive and (2) indicates&#160;that the seller is using the circumstances related to&#160;the public health emergency to increase prices unreasonably. The Federal Emergency Management Agency may issue proclamations designating necessary goods and services to which these prohibitions apply.

The bill requires enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission and imposes enhanced civil and criminal penalties for violations of prohibitions. It also authorizes a state attorney general to bring a civil action to enforce the prohibitions of this bill.</summary>
