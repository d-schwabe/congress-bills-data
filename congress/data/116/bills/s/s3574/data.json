The Federal Emergency Management Agency may issue proclamations designating necessary goods and services to which these prohibitions apply.\n\nThe bill requires enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission and imposes enhanced civil and criminal penalties for violations of prohibitions. It also authorizes a state attorney general to bring a civil action to enforce the prohibitions of this bill."
