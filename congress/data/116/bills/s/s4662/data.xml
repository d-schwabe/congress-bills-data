This bill establishes a new criminal offense for preventing or attempting to prevent a law enforcement officer from accessing emergency medical services for an injury caused by a criminal act or incurred in the line of duty.

An individual who engages in this conduct is subject to criminal penalties--a fine, a prison term of up to 20 years, or both. If death results, the prison term may be for a term of any years or for life.

In a prosecution of this offense, the government is not required to prove that the defendant knew the law enforcement officer suffered an injury caused by a criminal act or incurred in the line of duty.</summary>
