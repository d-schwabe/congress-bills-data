(The United States does not have official relations with Taiwan as a result of China's position that Taiwan is part of China. The American Institute in Taiwan is a private organization that has a contract with the State Department to represent U.S. interests in Taiwan and provide consular services.)\n\nThe State Department and the American Institute in Taiwan shall select a nonprofit organization to implement the fellowship program."
