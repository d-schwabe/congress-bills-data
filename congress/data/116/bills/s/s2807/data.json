Surveyors must provide programs with educational materials to help them correct any found deficiencies. If the CMS finds that a program does not meet applicable standards, the CMS may impose intermediate sanctions, including suspended Medicare payments, temporary management, and additional training; such programs must also undergo more frequent surveys until they are found to be in compliance."
