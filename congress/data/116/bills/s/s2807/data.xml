This bill establishes survey requirements for, and enforcement mechanisms against, certified hospice programs under Medicare.

Specifically, certified programs must undergo periodic surveys by a state, local, or approved accreditation agency, as specified; the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) must provide joint training for surveyors and programs, and must publish information relating to survey results on the Hospice Compare website. Surveyors must provide programs with educational materials to help them correct any found deficiencies. If the CMS finds that a program does not meet applicable standards, the CMS may impose intermediate sanctions, including suspended Medicare payments, temporary management, and additional training; such programs must also undergo more frequent surveys until they are found to be in compliance.</summary>
