This bill requires the Department of Commerce to establish national cybersecurity grand challenges to achieve high-priority breakthroughs in cybersecurity.

These challenges will offer cash and noncash prizes to winners and shall include competitions that encompass

 building more resilient systems that raise adversary costs of carrying out common cyberattacks, empowering people with a sufficient level of digital literacy to make safe and secure decisions online and developing a cybersecurity workforce to protect and maintain information systems, advancing cybersecurity efforts in response to emerging technologies, maintaining usability while improving the security and safety of individuals' online activity, and reducing cybersecurity risks to federal networks and systems and improving the response of federal agencies to cybersecurity incidents. Commerce must designate an advisory council to seek recommendations for the scope of the challenges and for metrics to assess submissions for prizes.</summary>
