This bill allows the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to more expeditiously issue a certificate of guarantee for certain loans related to Native American housing. Specifically, HUD may take such action before receiving the required trailing documents if the originating lender agrees to indemnify HUD for any losses during the period in which the required trailing documents are outstanding.</summary>
