The bill also contains other related provisions.\n\nGenerally, no later than 180 days before taking an action to reduce the U.S. presence in Europe, the President shall report to Congress (1) a justification for the action, (2) the scope and description of the reduction, (3) an explanation of the action's national security benefit, and (4) a plan to offset the reduction in conventional deterrence against Russian aggression stemming from the action. This requirement shall not apply if (1) a country hosting the U.S. forces requests the reduction in writing, or (2) Congress passes a joint resolution or act expressly authorizing the reduction.\n\nThe President shall report to Congress a detailed account of the decisionmaking process behind the decision to withdraw Armed Forces members from Germany that was announced on June 15, 2020."
