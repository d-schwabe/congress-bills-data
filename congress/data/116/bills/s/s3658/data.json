The bill defines underserved community to mean an historically disadvantaged community, including the Native American, African-American, Hispanic, Pacific Islander, Middle Eastern and North African, and rural communities.\n\nOERCI may award specified grants and enter into memoranda of understanding with state, local, tribal, and territorial government agencies. It shall develop measures to evaluate the effectiveness of its activities aimed at reducing disparities in preparedness, response, and recovery.\n\nDuring the period of time for which there is a major disaster or emergency declared by the President with respect to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019), OERCI shall regularly consult with state, local, territorial, and tribal government officials and community-based organizations from underserved communities that it identifies as disproportionately impacted by COVID-19."
