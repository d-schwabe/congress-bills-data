This bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to publish on its website the disability benefit questionnaire forms for non-VA medical providers submitting evidence regarding a disability of a claimant for purposes of VA benefits.

If the VA updates the questionnaire form, previous versions of the form filed by claimants must be accepted for up to one year after the form was updated.

The VA may waive interagency approval processes required to approve a modification to a form if such requirement applies by reason of the form being made public on the website as required by the bill.

The Inspector General of the VA must, through 2026, annually report on the use of such forms.</summary>
