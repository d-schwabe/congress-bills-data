This bill requires the Department of the Interior to (1) ban the venting and flaring of gas in oil and gas production operations on federal land onshore and offshore in the United States, with specified exceptions; and (2) promote the capture and beneficial use or reinjection of gas in such operations.

The bill also requires oil and gas companies to pay royalties on gas that is vented or flared pursuant to this bill.

The Government Accountability Office must assess such venting and flaring and estimate the volume of gas vented or flared in such operations each year.</summary>
