Currently, only states and certain local entities may apply for PHEP funds to respond to public health emergencies, such as COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019).\n\nThe CDC must award at least 10 cooperative agreements to tribal applicants.\n\nAdditionally, the CDC must consult with tribes and tribal organizations to ensure the PHEP program enables such entities to respond to public health emergencies. The CDC may make modifications to the program after such consultation."
