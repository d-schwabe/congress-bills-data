This bill requires states and local jurisdictions to allow absentee voting during the November 2020 general election for individuals impacted by COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019). It also establishes grants to implement online registration systems and to increase absentee voting.

Specifically, states and local jurisdictions must allow an individual to use absentee registration procedures and to vote by absentee ballot if the individual has a reasonable concern that voting in person on the date of the election may expose them to contracting COVID-19 or if&#160;they are otherwise impacted by COVID-19. The Department of Justice may bring a civil action against a state or local jurisdiction for violations.

In addition, the bill authorizes the Election Assistance Commission to award grants to states and local jurisdictions to (1) implement online absentee registration systems for the November 2020 general election, and (2) facilitate an increase in absentee voting during such election (e.g., the costs associated with the purchase of materials and educational outreach).</summary>
