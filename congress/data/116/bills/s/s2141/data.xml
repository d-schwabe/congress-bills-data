This bill expands the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program administered by the Small Business Administration (SBA).

Specifically, the bill (1) sets forth the specific goals of the SBIR program; (2) requires federal agencies that fail to meet minimum expenditure requirements for the SBIR program and the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program to report the reasons for their failure; and (3) and requires an agency that has allocated funds to a SBIR program to transfer a specified percentage of such funds to the Office of Investment and Administration of the SBA, which oversees the SBIR program.

In addition, the bill includes the SBIR and STTR programs in the Federal Aviation Administration's acquisition and management system.</summary>
