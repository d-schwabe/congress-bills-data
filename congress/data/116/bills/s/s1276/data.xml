This bill directs the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to carry out a pilot program to make grants to local governments to (1) enhance the production of maps relating to urban flooding and associated property damage; and (2) increase the availability of such maps to homeowners, businesses, and localities to enable them to minimize urban flooding risk.

 The grants may only be made to local governments in urbanized areas with populations greater than 50,000 or to stormwater management authorities in those localities.</summary>
