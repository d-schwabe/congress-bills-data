The Department of Education may reduce or waive the payments under certain circumstances.\n\nThe proceeds from\u00a0the\u00a0payments must be used for reducing student loan debt, delinquency, or default and increasing Pell grants at IHEs\u00a0with\u00a0low default rates that\u00a0enroll a high percentage of Pell Grant recipients."
