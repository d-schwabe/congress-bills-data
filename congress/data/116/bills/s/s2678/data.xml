This bill limits the participation of air carriers with labor law violations in the City Pair Program, which provides discounted air passenger transportation services to federal government travelers for work.

Specifically, the General Services Administration (GSA) must require an air carrier, as a condition of eligibility for the program, to disclose to the Department of Labor annually labor violations by the carrier or the carrier's subcontractors. Labor must submit to the GSA a list of air carriers that shall be ineligible for participation based on serious, repeated, willful, or pervasive violations.</summary>
