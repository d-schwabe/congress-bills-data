This bill directs the Department of Education (ED) to establish a grant program for preparing future teachers to effectively instruct English learners to achieve at high levels in early childhood education programs and in elementary schools and secondary schools. Under the program, grants must be given to partnerships between (1) certain institutions of higher education, and (2) high-need local educational agencies or high-need early childhood education programs. Grants may be awarded for up to five years. In awarding the grants, ED must give preference to partnerships that recruit and enroll teachers who are from underrepresented populations or former English learners.</summary>
