Specifically, multidisciplinary teams from within the child welfare system in each state must\n\n make a finding concerning the causes of each child fatality during the annual review period; submit such findings to the Child Death Review Case Reporting System; develop recommendations to prevent future child deaths from maltreatment; submit annual reports with this information to the state\u2019s governor and legislature; and if the number of child deaths in a state exceeds an established threshold, submit a report to the Children\u2019s Bureau of the Administration for Children and Families. Further, the Children\u2019s Bureau must promulgate rules establishing standardized definitions for states to use in such reporting."
