  <summary date="2020-05-11T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill provides states, tribal governments, and local governments with added spending discretion for part of their Coronavirus Relief Fund payment.

Currently, payments from the fund may only be used to cover certain costs that are necessary expenditures incurred due to the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) public health emergency.

The bill allows each state, tribal government, and unit of local government to use up to 25% of the amount paid to it for any purpose, including for expenditures to satisfy a nonfederal share requirement for any aid, assistance, grant, or other financial relief provided by the federal government.</summary>
