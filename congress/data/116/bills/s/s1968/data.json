These federal entities must then submit plans for repurposing their spectrum, or a portion thereof, for commercial wireless use.\n\nFurther, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration must consult with the Federal Communications Commission and the relevant federal entity to determine whether spectrum may be made available on an unlicensed basis if the entity determines it is not feasible to make spectrum available on a licensed basis in accordance with the bill."
