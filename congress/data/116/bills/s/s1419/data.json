Any difference between such advance notice and the notice of proposed rulemaking may not be considered arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nAdvance notice is not required if the proposing agency is not required to publish notice of proposed rulemaking or OIRA finds that such advance notice is not in the public interest or duplicative of another statutory requirement. Such a determination made by OIRA is not subject to judicial review."
