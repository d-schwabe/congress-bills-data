This bill appropriates funds for such grants.\n\nIn addition, ED must establish grant programs to pay the costs of an undergraduate education for students who commit to working for\u00a0at least three years in public service jobs upon graduation.\n\nFinally, ED must cancel\u00a0a certain percentage of the amount a borrower owes, based on the number of years of public service employment, on\u00a0federal student loans\u00a0made after this bill's enactment."
