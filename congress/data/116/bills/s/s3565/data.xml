This bill places restrictions on the collection of consumer and small business debts during a major disaster or emergency, including during the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) emergency period. Among other things, debt collectors may not during such a period

 enforce a security interest through a repossession or foreclosure, commence or continue litigation to collect a debt, terminate utility service, seize assets, commence or continue an eviction, or charge fees or apply a higher interest rate as a result of nonpayment. After such a period, debt collectors must provide certain repayment options including extending the repayment period for debts.

Violations of these provisions are subject to civil enforcement.</summary>
