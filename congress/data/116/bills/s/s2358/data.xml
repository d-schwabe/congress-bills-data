This bill expands eligibility for children to receive benefits under the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).

Specifically, the bill

 allows states to extend eligibility for the program until the period that ends on the earlier of the sixth birthday of a child or when the child enters kindergarten; extends the certification period under the program for infants to two years, instead of the current one year; and authorizes states to increase the certification time under the program for breastfeeding and non-breastfeeding women to two years postpartum.</summary>
