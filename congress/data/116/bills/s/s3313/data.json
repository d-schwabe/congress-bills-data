The bill specifies that this exemption applies only to those activities that do not promote the political agenda of a foreign government.\n\n Under current law, an institution of higher education is required to disclose to the Department of Education a gift or contract that is from a foreign source and is valued at $250,000 or more, considered alone or in combination with all other gifts from or contracts with a foreign source. The bill instead requires the institution to disclose such a gift or contract that is valued at $50,000 or more.\n\nAn institution must include in its disclosure report the contents of any such contract and make the contents available for public disclosure."
