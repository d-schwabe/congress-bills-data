This bill requires each institution of higher education&#160;(IHE) participating in the federal direct student loan program to pay 50% of&#160;any student loan balance that is in default for a loan that was used toward the cost of attendance at such IHE.

An IHE may not increase the costs of attendance in order to offset its liability to pay such balances.</summary>
