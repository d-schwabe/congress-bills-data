This bill prohibits each school food authority and local educational agency participating in the National School Lunch Program or the School Breakfast Program from collecting unpaid school meal fees (including late fees associated with unpaid meals) or using a debt collector to collect such fees during the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) public health emergency. The prohibition ends 30 days after the date on which the public health emergency is terminated.

Additionally, the Department of Agriculture must reimburse each school food authority and local educational agency participating in either program for unpaid meal fees (including late fees associated with unpaid meals) owed to the authority or agency as of the date of the enactment of this bill.</summary>
