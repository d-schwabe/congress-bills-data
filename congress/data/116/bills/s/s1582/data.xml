  <summary date="2019-05-21T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill establishes the White Sands National Park in New Mexico as a unit of the National Park System in order to protect, preserve, and restore the park's resources and recreational values and to enhance visitor experiences.

The bill abolishes the White Sands National Monument and incorporates the lands and interests that comprise the monument in and as a part of the park.

The Department of the Interior shall not nominate the park for inclusion on the World Heritage List of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) unless each county in which the park is located concurs in the nomination. Before submitting such a nomination, Interior must notify the Department of the Army of its intention to nominate the park for inclusion on the list.</summary>
