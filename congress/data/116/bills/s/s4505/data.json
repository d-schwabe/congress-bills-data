It also directs Treasury to award emergency education freedom grants to states.\n\nThe bill establishes a new tax credit for contributions to an eligible scholarship-granting organization. An eligible scholarship-granting organization is an tax-exempt organization that provides scholarships to individual elementary and secondary school students who reside in the state in which the organization is recognized or are members of a federally recognized Indian tribe. The organization must allocate at least 90% of contributions to qualifying scholarships on an annual basis and provide such scholarships to eligible students and families."
