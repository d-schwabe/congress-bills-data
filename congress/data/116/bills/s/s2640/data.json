The bill also makes ineligible any institution that has (1) filed for bankruptcy; (2) been convicted of, or pled nolo contendere or guilty to, a crime involving federal student aid; (3) committed fraud, substantial misrepresentation, or false certification involving federal student aid; or (4) executive officers who were previously employed at an institution receiving federal student aid that closed.\n\nAdditionally, the bill establishes certain criteria that an IHE must meet to be eligible for conversion from a for-profit IHE to a nonprofit IHE. Before approving such conversion, the Department of Education must publish the application in the Federal Register for notice and comment."
