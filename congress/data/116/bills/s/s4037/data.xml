This bill prohibits credit reporting agencies from including certain medical debt on a credit report if (1) the consumer was covered by a health insurance plan at the time of the medical event; and (2) the consumer has paid, or is paying as part of a payment plan, the consumer's share of copayments, deductibles, and coinsurance.

Credit reporting agencies are also prohibited from reporting certain debts incurred for unconscionably excessive medical expenses for health care items and services furnished at a hospital participating in Medicare.

The bill also provides for the removal from a credit report of an impairment resulting from a medical debt within 30 days of notification that the consumer (1) has paid in full, or (2) is in regular compliance with a payment plan.</summary>
