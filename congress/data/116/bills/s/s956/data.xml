This bill requires the disclosure of certain federal campaign contributions regardless of the purpose of the contribution, subject to other requirements. Currently, reporting is generally required for a contribution over a certain amount for

 a communication expressly advocating for the election or defeat of a candidate (i.e., an independent expenditure), or a broadcast, cable, or satellite communication during preelection periods that refers to a candidate, but does not call for election or defeat (i.e., an electioneering communication).</summary>
