This bill provides funding and establishes grants for states, Native American tribes, historically black colleges and universities, tribal colleges and universities, and minority-serving institutions.

Specifically, the bill requires the Department of Education to award grants to eligible states and Native American tribes to pay the federal share (75% of the average resident community college tuition and fees per student) of a program that provides funds to community colleges for waiving resident tuition and fees.

The bill also requires each state to ensure that a participating institution offers academic credits that are fully transferable to a four-year institution.

In addition, the bill establishes a grant program to encourage certain minority group students to enroll in and complete baccalaureate programs by requiring a university that receives grant funding to waive or significantly reduce tuition and fees for such students.</summary>
