This bill requires the Department of Labor to revise its registered apprenticeship programs to include additional program requirements for increasing the access of veterans and their survivors or dependents to such programs.

Labor must acquire written assurance that sponsors of apprenticeship programs (1) are aware of the availability of educational assistance for veterans and eligible individuals for use in such programs, (2) will make a good faith effort to obtain approval for such educational assistance for at least each program location that employs or recruits such recipients, and (3) will not deny a qualified applicant to avoid making a good faith effort to obtain approval for educational assistance.

In addition, Labor must (1) require program sponsors to provide standards that contain provisions to grant advanced standing or credit, (2) provide increased wages commensurate to such standing or credit for veterans or individuals eligible for educational assistance, and (3) provide a copy of the approved apprenticeship program's certificate of registration to the state approving agency.</summary>
