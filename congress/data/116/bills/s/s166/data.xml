  <summary date="2019-01-16T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill provides for protected presence status for certain types of aliens and mandatory appropriations for immigration enforcement.

The Department of Homeland Security shall grant provisional protected presence status to a qualified alien who applies for such status, which prevents removal from the United States and provides employment authorization. Such status shall be effective for three years from the bill's enactment.

To qualify for such status, the alien shall be a Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipient who was born after June 15, 1981, and entered the United States before age 16. The bill imposes other requirements, including enrolling in or having completed various types of schooling or military service.

The bill also provides for renewable provisional protected presence status for aliens who had temporary protected status or deferred enforced departure status on or before October 1, 2017. Renewable provisional protected presence status shall be granted for three years upon a successful application and is renewable indefinitely.

Both types of protected presence status are limited to aliens who have not been convicted of various crimes, do not pose a threat to national security, and have been physically present in the country for a certain amount of time.</summary>
