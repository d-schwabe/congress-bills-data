This bill permits an inspector general to be removed by the President or by a federal entity before the expiration of his or her term only for permanent incapacity, inefficiency, neglect of duty, malfeasance, or conviction of a felony or conduct involving moral turpitude.

The bill provides for a seven-year term of office for each inspector general. An individual may serve for more than one term.
