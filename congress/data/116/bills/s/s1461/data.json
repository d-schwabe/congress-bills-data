Further, plans are prohibited from (1) providing incentives for plan holders to forego infertility treatment, or (2) reducing the reimbursement rate to providers of such treatments.\n\nThe bill also extends infertility treatment and fertility preservation coverage to Medicaid enrollees, federal employees, members of the military, and veterans."
