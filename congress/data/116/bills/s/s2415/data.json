Such colleges and schools must use the grants for large pieces of wind component equipment (e.g., towers or blades) for use in training wind technician students.\n\nDOE must also establish a program to prepare veterans for careers in the wind energy industry that shall be modeled off of the Solar Ready Vets pilot program.\n\nIn addition, DOE must convene a task force to study the wind technician workforce."
