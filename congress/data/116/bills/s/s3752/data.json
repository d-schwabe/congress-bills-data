The bill also expands the uses of payments from the Coronavirus Relief Fund.\n\nThe bill allows a jurisdiction to use funding from the Coronavirus Local Community Stabilization Fund or Coronavirus Relief Fund for (1) necessary expenditures related to COVID-19 that were not accounted for in the jurisdiction's budget, including the nonfederal share contribution requirement for disaster or emergency assistance; or (2) expenditures the jurisdiction would otherwise be unable to make because of decreased or delayed revenues. Funding from the Coronavirus Local Community Stabilization Fund may be used for expenditures through 2022.\n\nThe bill (1) reserves specified funds for payments to tribal governments; (2) apportions funds to states based on population, infected population, and revenue lost; (3) provides for payments to counties and municipalities based on lost revenue.\n\nThe bill conditions funding on each state agreeing to fair and equitable budgeting based on need.\n\nThe Office of Inspector General of the Department of the Treasury may use amounts appropriated to carry out oversight and recoupment activities under this bill."
