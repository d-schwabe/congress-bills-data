A grant recipient may use the grant to acquire land or water providing outdoor recreation opportunities to the public.\n\nA grant may also be used to develop or renovate outdoor recreational facilities, with priority given to projects that\n\n create or significantly enhance access to park and recreational opportunities in an urban neighborhood or community, engage and empower underserved communities and youth, provide opportunities for youth employment or job training, establish or expand public-private partnerships, and take advantage of coordination among various levels of government. Grant funds may not be used for certain purposes, including grant administration costs, operation and maintenance activities, athletic facilities, or acquisition of lands or interests that restrict access to particular persons."
