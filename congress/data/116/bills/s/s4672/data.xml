  <summary date="2020-09-23T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Timely ReAuthorization of Necessary Stem-cell Programs Lends Access to Needed Therapies Act of 2020 or the TRANSPLANT Act of 2020 This bill modifies and reauthorizes through FY2025 the C.W. Bill Young Cell Transplantation Program, which provides support to patients who need a potentially life-saving bone marrow transplant or umbilical cord blood transplant. It also requires research and other activities related to stem cell therapies.

Specifically, the Department of Health and Human Services must conduct a periodic review of the science of using adult stem cells and birthing tissues in therapeutic treatments, and the National Institutes of Health must continue efforts to further the field of regenerative medicine using adult stem cells.

In addition, the Government Accountability Office must examine various issues related to the national blood stem cell workforce.</summary>
