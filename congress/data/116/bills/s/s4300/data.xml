  <summary date="2020-07-23T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill requires the Department of Defense (DOD) to implement the Pacific Deterrence Initiative. The initiative shall only take actions to (1) increase the lethality of the joint force in the Indo-Pacific region; (2) enhance the defense and posture of the joint force; (3) strengthen alliances and partnerships; and (4) carry out a program of exercises, experimentation, and innovation for the joint force.

DOD shall report a plan to Congress to expend in FY2021 and FY2022 certain minimum amounts to implement the initiative.

The bill also repeals authorization for DOD to carry out an earlier program known as the Indo-Pacific Stability Initiative.</summary>
