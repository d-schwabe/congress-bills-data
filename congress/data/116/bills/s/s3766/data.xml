This bill prohibits the President from blocking inspectors general from reporting to Congress regarding the implementation of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act and requires a report to Congress under specified circumstances involving denial of access to records under such act.

Specifically, if the Department of the Treasury Office of Inspector General, the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee, or the Office of the Special Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery determines that Treasury or the White House has not provided timely access or has impeded access to records regarding implementation of the CARES Act, then the office or committee shall report to Congress on the lack of access. If Treasury is responsible for the lack of access, then funding for the Office of the Secretary of the Treasury shall be rescinded until Treasury provides access to the records.</summary>
