This bill defers certain debts arising from benefits under laws administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) during the covered period, which is the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) emergency period plus the 60 days following the end of such period.

Specifically, the bill prohibits the VA from doing the following during the covered period:

 collecting or recording certain debts, issuing notice of certain debts to a person or consumer reporting agency, allowing any interest to accrue on certain debts, or applying any administrative fee to certain debts. The VA may collect a payment from a person who elects to make such payment during the covered period.</summary>
