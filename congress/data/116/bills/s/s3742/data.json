Such local funds or organizations may then use the amounts to assist small businesses (including sole proprietorships, independent contractors, and self-employed individuals) and nonprofits that (1) employ no more than 20 full-time employees (50 if the recipient is located in a low-income community), (2) has experienced a loss of revenue because of COVID-19, and (3) satisfies any additional requirements imposed by the administrator of the fund.\n\nA state, local government, or Native American tribe that receives funds under the bill must report specified demographic and disbursement information."
