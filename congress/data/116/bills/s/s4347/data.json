The task force must also provide guidance to prepare for future pandemics, including with respect to equipment levels, cleaning protocols, and leave and telework policies, and must also recommend ways to ensure labor organizations participate in agency decision-making. Each agency must also establish its own working group that addresses similar issues for the future."
