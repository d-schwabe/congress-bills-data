(Sec. 5) The bill specifies that NSF grants to research computer science education and computational thinking may be used to support development and implementation of various tools and models for teaching and learning, including\n\n developing and offering female-inclusive computer science enrichment programs, and acquainting female students in prekindergarten through elementary school with careers in computer science."
