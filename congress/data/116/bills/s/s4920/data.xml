This bill requires the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to take certain actions related to improving telework cybersecurity for small organizations.

Specifically, CISA must publish a resource on its website describing best practices a small organization may take to improve cybersecurity with respect to teleworking. The FTC must establish a program consistent with this resource to educate consumers and small organizations on improving the cybersecurity of technologies used for distance learning, telemedicine, and telework as a result of the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) public health emergency.</summary>
