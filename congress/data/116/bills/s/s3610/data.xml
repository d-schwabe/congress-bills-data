  <summary date="2020-05-05T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">American Healthshare Plans Act of 2020 This bill permits entities such as self-employed companies and membership organizations to form healthshare pools to offer large group health insurance plans as a single employer. (In general, large group health plans cover employees of an employer that has 51 or more employees; in some states, large groups are defined as 101 employees or more.) Subject to specified nondiscrimination rules related to preexisting conditions and health status, healthshare pools must offer plans to all members or employees of the pool on an equal basis. Healthshare pools are not considered joint employers for the purpose of other federal labor or employment laws.</summary>
