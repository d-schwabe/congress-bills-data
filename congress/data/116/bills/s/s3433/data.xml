This bill makes changes to the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL) of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

The bill expands the duties of the CRCL to include

 integrating civil rights and civil liberties protections into all DHS programs and activities; conducting civil rights and civil liberties impact assessments; initiating reviews, assessments, and investigations of the administration of DHS programs and activities; leading the equal employment opportunity programs of DHS; and engaging with individuals and communities whose civil rights and civil liberties may be affected by DHS programs and activities. The bill requires each operational component of DHS to designate an Officer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties to report to the CRCL.

The bill grants the CRCL the authority to issue subpoenas with the approval of the Secretary of DHS.

The CRCL must report annually to the President.

The Government Accountability Office shall report to Congress within two years of this bill's enactment.</summary>
