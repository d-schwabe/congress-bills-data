This bill directs the Department of Transportation (DOT) to establish an Arctic Shipping Federal Advisory Committee to advise DOT on matters related to Arctic maritime transportation, including Arctic seaway development.

The committee must

 develop a set of policy recommendations that would enhance the leadership role played by the United States in improving the safety and reliability of Arctic maritime transportation in accordance with customary international maritime law, consider establishing a congressionally chartered seaway development corporation modeled on the St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation, and provide advice and recommendations to DOT on Arctic marine transportation. The bill requires any Special Representative for the Arctic Region appointed by the Department of State to coordinate any activities recommended by the committee's implementation plan and to facilitate multilateral dialogues with member and observer nations of the Arctic Council.</summary>
