The FCC shall waive requirements that apply to certain funding for telecommunication and broadband services for health care providers if those requirements\u00a0prevent facilities that receive grants from carrying them out.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services must also provide recommendations related to immediately increasing access, during the emergency,\u00a0to telehealth services for which Medicare and Medicaid payments are available in skilled and other nursing facilities."
