This bill prohibits a dealer from selling, leasing, or loaning a used motor vehicle until a defect of the motor vehicle or motor vehicle equipment or noncompliance with a federal motor vehicle safety standard has been remedied, with specified exceptions.

The prohibition does not apply if (1) the recall information regarding the used vehicle was not available at the time of sale or lease and was not on the manufacturer's website; or (2) notification of the defect or noncompliance is required, but enforcement of an order to notify of and remedy the defect or noncompliance is set aside in a civil action on a motion for change of venue.</summary>
