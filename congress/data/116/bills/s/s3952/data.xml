This bill imposes sanctions on certain foreign individuals and entities involved in the theft of trade secrets belonging to a U.S. individual or entity.

The President shall periodically report to Congress a list of foreign individuals and entities that have knowingly engaged in, knowingly benefited from, or assisted in the significant theft of U.S. trade secrets that materially contributed to a significant threat to U.S. national security, foreign policy, or economic health. The report shall also list the foreign persons who are chief executive officers and board members of any foreign entity engaging in such theft.

Individuals named in the report shall be subject to property- and visa-blocking sanctions. The President shall impose either property- or export-blocking sanctions on entities named in the report.</summary>
