This bill requires the Department of Education to (1) award grants for state-federal partnerships with a goal of providing debt-free college for students at in-state public institutions of higher education, and (2) award grants to provide debt-free college for students at historically black colleges and universities and minority serving institutions, and (3) allow grants for financial aid for dreamer students (students who entered the United States before the age of 16 and who meet certain educational criteria). It also repeals the suspension of eligibility for financial aid for students convicted of the possession or sale of illegal drugs.</summary>
