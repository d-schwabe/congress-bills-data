  <summary date="2020-02-12T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Ethical Use of Facial Recognition Act

This bill prohibits any officer, employee, or contractor of a federal agency from engaging in specified activities with respect to facial recognition technology without a warrant until a congressional commission established by this bill recommends rules governing the use and limitations on both government and commercial use of such technology.

Specifically, it prohibits any such individual from setting up a camera to be used in connection with facial recognition technology, accessing or using information obtained from such technology, or importing such technology to identify an individual in the United States until Congress enacts legislation implementing the guidelines established by the commission.

The bill permits an aggrieved person to bring a civil action for injunctive or declaratory relief in the appropriate U.S. district court. No federal funds may be used by a state or local government to invest in facial recognition software, purchase facial recognition technology services, or acquire images for use in facial recognition technology systems.</summary>
