The bill also requires that specified portions of funding made available under the bill be used for water and energy efficiency.\n\nIn administering such funding made available under the bill, the relevant federal agencies must consult with grantees and recipients and meet with state and local government officials for the purpose of recommending and promoting funding opportunities and initiatives to include minority and women's business enterprises in such grant activities."
