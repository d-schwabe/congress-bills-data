The Department of Labor shall (1) award grants for a domestic worker national hotline for reporting emergencies, training on hazards facing domestic workers, and workforce investment activities for domestic workers; and (2) establish a Domestic Worker Wage and Standards Board to investigate standards in the domestic workers industry.\n\nLabor must provide domestic workers with a document that describes the rights and protections under the domestic workers bill of rights.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services must collect state Medicaid program data on the personal or home care aide workforce."
