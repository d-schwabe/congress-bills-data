Further, the State Department must brief Congress on Russian and Iranian influence in Syria, U.S. activities to counter such influence, and the ability of ISIS to reconstitute.\n\n The President must oppose loans to Turkey from international finance institutions and impose sanctions against identified foreign persons that provided Turkey with defense articles, services, or technology for its operations in Syria. The bill also authorizes the President to provide humanitarian assistance to the people of Syria, and it requires the State Department to give priority designation to certain Syrian Kurds as refugees of special humanitarian concern.\n\nAdditionally, the bill prohibits the sale of arms to Turkey for its operations in Syria, and it imposes sanctions against persons providing arms to Turkish forces in Syria. It also imposes sanctions against senior Turkish government officials, financial institutions that facilitate transactions for Turkish Armed Forces, and Russian persons supporting the Assad regime."
