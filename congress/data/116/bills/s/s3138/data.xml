This bill expands the scope of advance directive policies and related disclosures for providers under Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).

Specifically, providers (e.g., hospitals, hospice programs, and home health care providers) must have advance directive policies for minors (rather than only adults) and must disclose such policies on the provider's website and upon request. Providers must also disclose information regarding (1) an individual's rights with respect to life-sustaining procedures, including hydration and sustenance; and (2) whether parental consent is required to provide, withdraw, or deny life-sustaining procedures, or to institute a do-not-resuscitate order, for a minor.</summary>
