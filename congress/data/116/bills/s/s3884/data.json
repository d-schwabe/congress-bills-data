    "text": "Essential Transportation Employee Safety Act of 2020\n\nThis bill requires the Department of Transportation (DOT) to support the efforts of state and local governments to provide for priority COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) testing of transportation workers who are categorized as essential critical infrastructure workers. (Essential critical infrastructure employees include, but are not limited to, medical and health care, telecommunications, information technology systems, defense, food and agriculture, transportation and logistics, energy, water and wastewater, law enforcement, and public works.)\n\nAdditionally, during the COVID-19 pandemic, DOT must require (1) the owners and operators of equipment or facilities used by passenger or freight transportation employers implement personal protective equipment and disinfection and sanitization procedures; and (2) an air carrier to submit to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) a proposal to permit pilots to wear masks or protective face coverings in the flight deck, including a safety risk assessment with respect to such proposal.\n\nThe bill sets forth requirements for owners or operators who cannot acquire necessary personal protective equipment due to market unavailability.\n\nFor the duration of the COVID-19 national emergency, the FAA must (1) provide certain employees, including any air traffic controller and airway transportation systems specialist, with personal protective and sanitizing equipment; (2) ensure that each air traffic control facility is cleaned, disinfected, and sanitized frequently; and (3) ensure its contractors provide their employees with personal protective equipment."
