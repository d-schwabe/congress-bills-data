This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to (1) expand the definition of, and requirements relating to, "program-related investments" made by private foundations to for-profit entities to further certain charitable purposes; (2) allow a judicial determination (i.e., declaratory judgment) as to whether investments in any entity qualify as program-related investments; (3) require expanded reporting by for-profit entities that receive program-related investments of their gross income, expenses, disbursements, and other information; and (4) allow public inspection of any petition seeking a determination that an investment by a private foundation is a program-related investment and of any information reported by organizations receiving program-related investments.</summary>
