Additionally, one-third of such issuer's\u00a0board of directors\u00a0must be\u00a0elected by employees for the issuer to be allowed\u00a0to register securities.\n\nThe bill also repeals the Securities and Exchange Commission regulation (Rule 10b-18) that generally provides a safe harbor from market manipulation liability for an issuer engaging in a stock buyback."
