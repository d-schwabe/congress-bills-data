This bill provides that, upon request of a community that has received emergency flood-fighting assistance involving the construction of a temporary structure, the U.S. Department of the Army shall evaluate whether the structure should be made permanent.

If the Army makes such a determination, it (1) shall begin planning, design, and construction of a permanent feature if the total construction cost of the project is not expected to exceed $25 million; and (2) shall seek congressional authorization if construction cost is expected to be in excess of that amount.</summary>
