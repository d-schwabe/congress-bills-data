The office aims to (1) expand the commercialization of DOE's research investments; and (2) focus on commercializing technologies that support DOE's missions, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIn addition, the bill requires DOE to review and report on all of its applied energy research and development programs that focus on researching and developing technologies that reduce such emissions. Under the review, DOE must identify each program with a mission to research and develop technologies that reduce emissions, determine the type of services provided by each program, and determine whether there are written program goals for each program.\n\nDOE must make recommendations on such emission-reduction programs, including recommendations on how to (1) restructure or consolidate overlapping programs, and (2) increase collaboration among federal agencies and stakeholders on emission-reduction technologies."
