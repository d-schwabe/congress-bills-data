The bill defines a beneficial owner as an individual who (1) exercises substantial control over a corporation or limited liability company, (2) owns 25% or more of the interest in a corporation or limited liability company, or (3) receives substantial economic benefits from the assets of a corporation or limited liability company.\n\nThe bill also generally expands and revises existing AML-CFT provisions, including by\n\n compelling foreign banks to comply with subpoenas for records and allowing fines for foreign banks that fail to comply, establishing a financial institution liaison at FinCEN, initiating a review of thresholds for currency transaction reports and suspicious activity reports, and expanding the regulation of digital currencies. The bill also requires increased communication and data sharing between law enforcement, financial regulators, and financial institutions.\n\nThe bill provides statutory authority for the Securities and Exchange Commission to seek disgorgement (i.e., repayment) as a remedy for unjust enrichment that a person gained through a securities law violation.\n\nThe bill also revises administrative requirements of FinCEN, including by revising the pay scale of employees."
