    "text": "Mothers and Offspring Mortality and Morbidity Awareness Act or the MOMMA's Act\n\nThis bill establishes various programs and requirements to support the prevention of maternal mortality. Specifically, the bill requires the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to provide technical assistance and best practices for collecting data, standardizing reporting, and preventing maternal mortality. The CDC also must provide grants for state-based collaboratives to improve care immediately before and after birth and improve outcomes for maternal and infant health. Further, the Health Resources and Services Administration must establish a grants program to support national organizations in assisting state-level health care systems to implement standardized, evidence-informed processes for maternal health focusing on reducing maternal mortality.\n\nThe bill also establishes regional centers to address implicit bias and cultural competency in the delivery of health care services. Specified institutions that provide education and training to health care professionals and focus on maternal mortality are eligible for funding through the program. The bill extends coverage for pregnant and postpartum women under Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program for one year postpartum and such coverage is revised to include oral health services. Additionally, the bill (1) increases the excise tax on specified tobacco products, including cigarettes; (2) expands the definition of other tobacco products to include any such product as determined by the Food and Drug Administration; and (3) requires that such products are taxed at a rate equivalent to cigarettes on a per-use basis."
