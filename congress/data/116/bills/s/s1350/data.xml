  <summary date="2019-05-07T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Good Samaritan Health Professionals Act of 2019

This bill shields health care professionals from liability under federal or state law for harm caused by an act or omission while (1) the professional is serving as a volunteer in response to a disaster; and (2) such act or omission occurs during the period of the disaster, in the state where the disaster has been declared, in the professional's capacity as a volunteer, during the course of providing a service for which the professional is licensed or certified, and with a good faith belief that the individual being treated is in need of health care services.

This protection from liability does not apply if (1) the harm was caused by an act or omission constituting willful or criminal misconduct, gross negligence, reckless misconduct, or a conscious flagrant indifference to the rights or safety of the individual harmed; or (2) the professional rendered the health care services under the influence of alcohol or an intoxicating drug.</summary>
