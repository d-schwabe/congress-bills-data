This bill authorizes the Society of the First Infantry Division to modify the First Division Monument located on federal land in Presidential Park, District of Columbia, to honor members of the First Infantry Division of the U.S. Army who died during U.S. operations, including Operation Desert Storm, Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation New Dawn, and Operation Enduring Freedom.

The First Infantry Division must provide the society with a list of names to be added to the monument.

The Commemorative Works Act, which prohibits monuments to military units, shall not apply to this authorization.

Federal funds may not be used to pay the society for the modification.</summary>
