This bill allows a new refundable income tax credit for individual taxpayers (to be known as the Middle Class Tax Credit) equal to the lesser of $500 ($1,000 for individuals filing joint returns), or the taxpayer's earned income for the taxable year. The amount of the credit is reduced by 2.5% percent of the taxpayer's modified adjusted gross income that exceeds $50,000 ($100,000 for individuals filing joint returns).</summary>
