This bill authorizes grant programs to increase the resiliency of water infrastructure to natural hazards.

Specifically, it requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish a grant program for increasing the resilience of publicly owned treatment works to natural hazards.

In addition, the bill reauthorizes through FY2024 and revises the EPA's Drinking Water System Infrastructure Resilience and Sustainability Program. Under the program, the EPA must award grants to community water systems for increasing their resilience to natural hazards.</summary>
