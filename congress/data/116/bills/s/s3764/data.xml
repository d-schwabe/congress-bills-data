This bill directs the Department of the Treasury to establish as a permanent program the Federal Child Savings Account Program not later than December 31, 2021. A program account shall be tax-exempt and distributions from an account shall be excludible from a child's gross income.

The program allows the parent or guardian of a child under the age of 18 and a U.S. resident to make contributions to an account for the child's educational expenses. An account may also fund a Roth Individual Retirement account and an ABLE (i.e., Achieving a Better Life Experience) account for disabled individuals. Distributions from such accounts may begin on the earlier of the date such child attains the age of 26, receives an associate's or bachelor's degree, or enlists in active duty miliary service.</summary>
