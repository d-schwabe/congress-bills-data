This bill reauthorizes through FY2025 and revises the American History for Freedom grant program.

The bill renames the program as the American Civics Education Program.

The bill authorizes the Department of Education to award grants to institutions of higher education (IHEs) once every three years to establish or strengthen academic programs to promote American political thought and history; the history, achievements, and impact of American representative democracy and constitutional democracies globally; and the means of participation in political and civic life. Currently, such grants are awarded to IHEs for three years and are focused on traditional American history and the history and achievements of Western civilization.

IHEs may use grants to support additional activities, such as collaborating with federal or state humanities programs and using open educational resources.</summary>
