This bill prescribes the notice the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) must provide in the event a person submits a claim for damage, injury, or death on Standard Form 95 (related to tort claims occurring within the scope of an employee's federal employment). Specifically, the VA must provide to the claimant, within 30 days after the claim is submitted, notice of (1) the importance of obtaining legal advice, including a recommendation that the claimant should secure legal counsel; and (2) the employment status of any individual listed on the form.

Additionally, if the claim involves a contractor that entered into an agreement with the VA, the VA must provide the claimant notice of the importance of obtaining legal advice as to the statute of limitations regarding the claim in the state in which the claim arose.</summary>
