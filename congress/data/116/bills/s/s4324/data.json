Further, it prohibits any federal grant application that fails to disclose the receipt of any outside compensation, including foreign compensation.\n\nThe bill establishes investments and incentives to support U.S. semiconductor manufacturing, research and development, and supply chain security, such as requiring the National Institute of Standards and Technology to carry out a semiconductor manufacturing program to accelerate research and development for next generation semiconductors.\n\nLastly, the bill addresses availability, development, and production of domestic critical minerals by (1) requiring the President to coordinate agencies to implement U.S. policy regarding critical minerals, including by establishing a capability for identifying critical mineral demand and supply; (2) establishing a grant program for critical mineral education, training, and workforce development programs at institutions of higher education; and (3) reauthorizing through FY2030 the National Geological and Geophysical Data Preservation Program."
