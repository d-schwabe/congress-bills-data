The bill expands SCAAP to require DOJ to provide compensation for incarcerating aliens whose immigration status cannot be definitively identified.\n\nThe bill also expands the definition of an \"undocumented criminal alien\" to include qualifying aliens who were charged with a felony or two misdemeanors, where the statute currently requires convictions of such crimes. The bill also authorizes the program through FY2024."
