Additionally, the bill establishes a family and medical leave insurance benefit program to provide up to 60 days of partially-paid leave for qualifying circumstances including to care for a specified close relative with a serious health condition. The bill establishes a trust to pay benefits under the program, which is funded by an employer payroll tax and employee income tax."
