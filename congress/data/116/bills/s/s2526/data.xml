  <summary date="2019-09-19T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill directs the Department of Energy (DOE) to identify a portion of federal land within the Durango disposal site that is suitable for conveyance to Colorado to be used as a storage site for residual radioactive materials as part of remediation activities carried out by the state related to properties in the vicinity of the Durango processing site.

DOE must ensure that the identified land is (1) approximately 0.25 acres, (2) located in the southwestern corner of the Durango disposal site, and (3) south of and bounded by County Road 212.

After DOE offers to convey the identified land to the state, and the state accepts the offer, DOE shall convey to the state all interest of the United States in and to such land.

As a condition of such conveyance, DOE must require the state to manage the conveyed land consistent with the requirements of the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978 relating to the Durango disposal site, including after the use of it has ceased.</summary>
