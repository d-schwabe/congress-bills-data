Such partnership may also include other entities such as a state agency responsible for administering career and technical education, a labor organization, or an economic development agency.\n\nA partnership that receives a grant must use the funds to develop and implement a postsecondary apprenticeship program in a high-skill, high-wage, and in-demand industry sector or occupation. Additionally, an apprenticeship shall qualify as a work-study program through which a student apprentice is eligible for federal financial assistance."
