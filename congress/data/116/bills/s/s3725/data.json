It also directs polling places to follow certain guidance related to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) preparedness.\n\nSpecifically, each state and local jurisdiction must permit no-excuse mail-in absentee voting. Among other things, each state and jurisdiction must (1) provide a mail-in ballot with prepaid return postage to each registered voter who requests such a ballot, (2) allow voters to submit online ballot requests, (3) allow voters to cure certain signature discrepancies, and (4) provide secured drop-off boxes from 45 days before the date of the election.\n\nEach state and local jurisdiction must maintain an early in-person voting period of at least 20 days.\n\nAdditionally, each state must establish a plan to ensure that polling places are implementing guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention related to COVID-19 preparedness. Among other requirements, each plan must (1) keep as many voting locations open as possible, (2) prepare polling locations to implement social distancing protocols, (3) provide sufficient quantities of hygiene and cleaning supplies at polling locations, and (4) provide hazard pay and protective equipment to poll workers.\n\nThe Election Assistance Commission (EAC) must make a payment, within 30 days, to each state to carry out these requirements.\n\nFinally, the EAC must make payments to eligible states to carry out certain activities related to in-person voting, such as ensuring that elections are accessible to individuals with disabilities and implementing curbside voting."
