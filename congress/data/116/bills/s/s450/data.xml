This bill addresses the administration of the hiring process for Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) personnel. Specifically, the bill requires the VA to publish on a VA website specified information related to the duration of the hiring process for certain health care appointees, such as physicians.

The VA Office of Inspector General must review the administration of such website annually, instead of the current semiannual requirement.

Lastly, the bill requires the VA to include in its annual hiring report the steps it is taking to improve the onboarding timeline at facilities where the duration of the process exceeds suggested metrics.</summary>
