Emphasis shall be placed on increasing the number of skilled individuals from underrepresented groups trained to work in those jobs.\n\nDOE must establish an online resource center\n\n to maintain and update information and resources on training programs for such jobs; and as a resource for specified agencies, organizations, and apprenticeship programs working to develop and implement training programs for the jobs. The Department of Labor must provide grants to certain businesses or labor management organizations to pay the wages of employees when they are receiving training for jobs in the renewable energy, energy efficiency, grid modernization sectors or for reducing greenhouse gas emissions."
