This bill requires institutions of higher education (IHEs) to take certain health and safety actions to respond to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019), specifically for college athletes.

Specifically, the bill prohibits IHEs from (1) allowing any individual to agree to a liability waiver for any sporting activity, or (2) canceling a scholarship or any other financial aid provided to a college athlete who does not participate in team activities due to concerns about COVID-19.

Further, each IHE must inform its college athletes when a college athlete or a staff member of its athletic department tests positive for COVID-19, without revealing any personally identifiable information about the individual.

Additionally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must, within 90 days, develop health and safety guidelines related to COVID-19 for athletic departments of IHEs. IHEs must comply with these guidelines.

The bill also provides a private right of action for individuals affected by violations of the bill.</summary>
