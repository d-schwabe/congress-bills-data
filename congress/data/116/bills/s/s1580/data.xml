This bill addresses the process of consultation with military installations in cases of applications for wind farm projects filed with the Department of Transportation.

 It provides that, with respect to an application for a wind farm project, the Military Aviation and Installation Assurance Siting Clearinghouse shall (1) verify whether the appropriate commander, in consultation with each such installation, approved or objected to the application; (2) publish the procedures for notifying each installation of the application; and (3) at least annually, report to Congress a list of approvals and objections and an assessment of whether approved wind farm projects impacted the training capabilities, operations, or readiness of the military department concerned.</summary>
