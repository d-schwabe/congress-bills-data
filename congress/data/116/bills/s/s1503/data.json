Such a contract shall include a clause prohibiting the contractor from receiving the compensation.\n\nContracts with contractors that received an average of more than $1 billion in revenue in the previous three years from DOD or the Department of Energy (related to the U.S. nuclear program) shall prohibit the employment or payment of certain DOD officials within four years of leaving DOD service.\n\nIn addition, the bill includes restrictions and conditions concerning:\n\n lobbying by former officials and officers; stock ownership and trading; employment that is subject to the emoluments clause of the Constitution; work by certain senior officials for a foreign entity (including work that conflicts with U.S. national security interests); financial disclosure by large prospective contractors; and public disclosure of information regarding the identification of general or flag officers and their finances and conduct."
