  <summary date="2020-06-22T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">National Broadband Plan for the Future Act of 2020

This bill requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to update the national broadband plan, which establishes benchmarks to meet the goal of ensuring that all people of the United States have access to broadband capability.

Such update shall include (1) an assessment of the progress in achieving the goals of the original national broadband plan; (2) an examination of the effects of the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic on how people learn, work, receive medical information and treatment, and participate in civic communications; and (3) an analysis of the reliance people will have on services enabled by broadband internet access service, both prior to comprehensive COVID-19 testing and vaccine development and after the pandemic has ended.

The FCC must report annually on its progress toward achieving the goals of the updated national broadband plan.</summary>
