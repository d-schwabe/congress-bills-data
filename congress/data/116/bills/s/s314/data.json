The agent shall establish a policy and implementation plan for improving security clearance procedures.\n\nThe agent shall report to Congress on (1) ways to improve or simplify investigation procedures; (2) the feasibility of the clearance in person concept, which permits an individual to maintain access to classified information for up to three years after leaving a cleared position; and (3) protections for the confidentiality of whistleblower-related communications in continuous vetting programs.\n\nFederal departments and agencies shall report annually to the agent certain information related to reciprocal recognition of security clearances when an individual moves between positions within the department or agency, and the agent shall summarize and report such information to Congress.\n\nThe bill imposes various targets for reducing the pendency of secret and top secret level clearance determinations. It also requires reports to Congress on various topics, such as the feasibility of having no more than three tiers of trust and security clearance positions."
