  <summary date="2020-08-03T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Uterine Fibroid Research and Education Act of 2020

This bill directs specified components of the Department of Health and Human Services to take certain actions to address uterine fibroids (i.e., muscular tumors that grow in the wall of the uterus and may cause pain, heavy menstrual bleeding, and reproductive issues).

Specifically, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), working through the Office of Research on Women's Health, must undertake research activities on uterine fibroids. In carrying out this research, the office must coordinate with specified components of the NIH and other federal agencies.

In addition, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services must (1) collect data from Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program about treatment and services related to uterine fibroids, and (2) develop a report in coordination with federal partners on federal and state expenditures for these treatments and services.

Additionally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Health Resources Service Administration (HRSA), and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) must disseminate information about uterine fibroids, including the&#160;elevated risk for minority women and information regarding available treatments. Specifically, the CDC shall disseminate the information to the public, while HRSA and AHRQ shall disseminate it to health care providers.</summary>
