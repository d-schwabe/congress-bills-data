In carrying out this research, the office must coordinate with specified components of the NIH and other federal agencies.\n\nIn addition, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services must (1) collect data from Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program about treatment and services related to uterine fibroids, and (2) develop a report in coordination with federal partners on federal and state expenditures for these treatments and services.\n\nAdditionally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Health Resources Service Administration (HRSA), and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) must disseminate information about uterine fibroids, including the\u00a0elevated risk for minority women and information regarding available treatments. Specifically, the CDC shall disseminate the information to the public, while HRSA and AHRQ shall disseminate it to health care providers."
