This bill establishes various bodies to investigate and seek damages from China relating to its response to the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) outbreak. The bill also allows a foreign government to be sued in U.S. district court regarding&#160;that government's actions related to the COVID-19 outbreak.

A foreign government shall not have sovereign immunity against a lawsuit in the United States seeking money damages for physical or economic injury occurring in the United States following any reckless action or omission of that foreign government (or any official or agent of that government) that caused or substantially aggravated the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States.

The President shall establish a task force to investigate and secure damages from China's government related to China's response to the COVID-19 outbreak.

The Department of State shall form a delegation to the International Commission to Investigate the Role of the Government of the People's Republic of China in the COVID-19 Global Pandemic. The delegation shall form the commission with U.S. allies and partners.
