This bill limits the provision of financial and technical assistance for the production or funding of a film for screening in China.

The President may only authorize the provision of technical support or access to an asset controlled by the federal government for, or authorize a federal agency to enter into a contract related to, the production or funding of a film by a U.S. company, if the company

 provides to the the Department of Commerce a list of all films produced or funded by the company whose content has been submitted, during a specified period, to a Chinese official or the Chinese Communist Party for evaluation for screening in China; enters into a written agreement with the President or the federal agency not to alter the content of the film in response to, or in anticipation of, a request by a Chinese official or the Chinese Communist Party; and submits such agreement to Commerce. The bill requires specified annual reports on the films disclosed pursuant to such limitation.

The President may not authorize the provision of such support, access, or authorization of such a contract if (1) the film is co-produced by an entity located in China that is subject to conditions on content imposed by a Chinese official or the Chinese Communist Party, or (2) the company is listed in the most recent annual report.</summary>
