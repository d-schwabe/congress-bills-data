It reduces by 10% the JAG allocation of a state that fails to comply.\n\nAdditionally, for an initial four-year period, the Department of Justice (DOJ) may give preference to a Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program grant applicant from a state that reports data on deadly shootings by law enforcement. Beginning in the fifth year, DOJ must reduce by 20% the COPS allocation of a state that fails to report such data."
