Currently, DOE may only lease these storage facilities to foreign governments. DOE must ensure that leasing of facilities to foreign governments will not impair national security.\n\nIn addition, DOE must conduct a program to lease storage capacity for up to 200 million barrels of petroleum products at storage facilities of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and related facilities."
