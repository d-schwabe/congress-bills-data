Among other things, these accounts must provide specified banking services to eligible persons who elect to deposit funds into these accounts, including access to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) aid payments. These accounts may not charge fees or have balance requirements, and must provide a specified interest rate.\n\nIn areas with limited access to Federal Reserve member banks, these banks must partner with postal retail facilities to provide services.\n\nFederal Reserve banks must permit state nonmember banks and credit unions to open master accounts for the purpose of offering digital pass-through accounts.\n\nPostal retail facilities and certain small banks must be reimbursed by the appropriate Federal Reserve bank for operational costs incurred by offering the accounts."
