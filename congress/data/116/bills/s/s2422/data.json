    "text": "Clean Energy Grid Act of 2019\n\nThis bill directs the Department of Energy (DOE) to address the integration of clean distributed energy into electric grids. Clean distributed energy means energy (e.g., solar and wind energy) that is generated on or near customer sites and interconnected with the electric grid. Specifically, DOE must\n\n study the status of integration of clean distributed energy into electric grids, identify issues requiring additional research or regulatory development, make grants for research proposals that address technical barriers identified in the study, establish and distribute to states best practices to encourage the integration of clean distributed energy into the grid, and convene a working group of stakeholders to address regulatory barriers to deployment of intelligent grid integration of clean distributed energy technologies. DOE may make grants to implement integration demonstration projects."
