This bill modifies eligibility requirements for Small Business Administration (SBA) contracting opportunities available to a woman- or minority-owned business.

Currently, to be eligible for certain SBA programs, a woman or minority business owner must own an unconditional majority (at least 51%) of their business. However, the bill allows a woman- or minority-owned small business to maintain its contracting eligibility in the event a venture capital or private equity firm purchases an ownership stake in the business, so long as the purchasing enterprise is also owned by either a woman or minority.</summary>
