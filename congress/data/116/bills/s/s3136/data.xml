  <summary date="2019-12-19T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Small Business Start-up Savings Accounts Act of 2019

This bill allows an individual or eligible small business (500 or fewer employees) to establish a small business start-up savings account. The taxpayer may deduct contributions to such start-up accounts in the amount of $10,000, or $150,000, reduced by aggregate contributions for all taxable years, whichever is the lesser amount. Qualified distributions (e.g, for purchase of equipment, marketing, training, or accounting fees) from such accounts are excluded from gross income, for income tax purposes.

The bill also imposes penalty taxes on excess contributions to a small business start-up savings account and for nonqualified distributions from such an account.</summary>
