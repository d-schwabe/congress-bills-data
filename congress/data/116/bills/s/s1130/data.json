The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) must award grants to eligible applicants to (1) conduct comprehensive death scene investigations, (2) increase the rate of standardized autopsies, and (3) obtain informed consent from families to collect genetic or tissue samples for research into the causes of such deaths. The bill also provides grants for training medical examiners, and other appropriate personnel, about standardized investigative practices, including the infant or child's medical history, and other circumstances surrounding the death. Further, the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) of the Department of Health and Human Services also must provide grants to states to develop the capacity for local governments to comprehensively review 100% of all infant and child deaths and maintain the National Fatality Review Case Reporting System. Further, the CDC must use such national reporting system to compile and make publicly available summary data about sudden unexpected infant and childhood deaths. The CDC also must revise its death investigation forms to align with the form used under the national reporting system. Additionally, the bill requires the ACF to award grants to (1) promote evidence-based best practices, (2) support prevention efforts, and (3) provide safe-sleep products."
