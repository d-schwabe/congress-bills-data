The bill defines qualified remote work expenses as expenses paid or incurred to allow employees to work from a worksite other than a shared office space, that are necessary to allow for continuation of normal business functions, are in response to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019), and occur after February 15, 2020, and before January 1, 2021. The bill also extends such tax credit to tax-exempt entities.\n\nThe bill also allows an income-based tax deduction for remote work expenses."
