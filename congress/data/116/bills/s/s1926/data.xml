  <summary date="2019-06-20T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">PrEP Access and Coverage Act

This bill requires private health insurance plans to cover prescription drugs that prevent the acquisition of HIV, and any related screenings, diagnostic procedures, or clinical follow-ups, without any cost-sharing obligation for the plan holder. Further, insurance plans must not impose any preauthorization requirement for this coverage. These coverage requirements also apply to public health insurance programs, including, among others, Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children's Health Insurance Program.

Additionally, the bill prohibits denying, limiting, or qualifying coverage or increasing premiums for disability insurance, long-term care insurance, or life insurance policies based on a person taking medication for HIV prevention.

The bill further requires the Department of Health and Human Services to award grants to states, or directly to eligible local organizations, to provide uninsured individuals access to prescription drugs and related services that prevent HIV. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also must develop a public awareness campaign that focuses efforts in communities with a high need for HIV prevention treatment.</summary>
