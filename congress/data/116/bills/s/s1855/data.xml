This bill revises the Pell Grant Program to provide incentives for&#160;institutions of higher education (IHEs) to increase (1) enrollment of students who receive Pell Grants, and (2) graduation rates of their students.

Specifically, the Department of Education (ED) must&#160;rank IHEs participating in student financial aid programs. First, ED must rank IHEs based on the percentage of first-time, full-time students who receive Pell Grants and are enrolled at the IHEs. The IHEs in the bottom 5% must improve the enrollment of those students by specific deadlines or pay a fee-per-student penalty.

Second, ED must rank&#160;IHEs based on the percentage of first-time, full-time students who enroll at the school and graduate within six years. The bill gives IHEs in the bottom 5% the option of receiving funding to improve student graduation rates. Those IHEs must improve those rates by specific deadlines or pay a penalty.

ED must&#160;use the fees to fund (1)&#160;grant programs for improving graduation rates; and (2) a bonus program for providing nonfinancial rewards to IHEs with proven records of affordability, access, and success for low- income,&#160;moderate-income, or working class students.&#160;</summary>
