This bill authorizes a federal student loan borrower to terminate repayment under an income-based repayment plan and instead elect to repay such loan under any other repayment plan for which they are eligible.

Currently, a federal student loan borrower repaying under an income-based repayment plan may only change to the standard repayment plan.</summary>
