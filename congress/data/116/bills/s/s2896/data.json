Also, the park shall coordinate\n\n the preservation, protection, and interpretation efforts of the park by the federal government, Illinois, units of local government, and private and nonprofit organizations; and the management options necessary to ensure these efforts toward the many significant aspects of the park. The park's boundary shall be established by the Department of the Interior, but must not exceed the boundary of the approximately 300-acre Pullman Historic District in Chicago.\n\nUpon conveyance by Illinois to Interior, the park shall include\n\n the Pullman Factory Complex, including the Clock Tower Building and rear erecting shops; and the approximately 13 acres of land on which those structures are located. Interior must complete a general management plan for the park."
