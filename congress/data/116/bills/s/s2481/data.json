    "text": "End Neglected Tropical Diseases Act\n\nThis bill expands programs to address neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), which are infections caused by pathogens, including viruses, microbes, and helminths (parasitic worms), that disproportionately impact individuals living in extreme poverty, especially in developing countries. Examples include dengue, leprosy, and rabies.\n\nThe bill sets forth certain priorities for the NTDs Program of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), including the coordination of program activities with other USAID development sectors regarding (1) education; (2) food security; and (3) water, sanitation, and hygiene.\n\nThe bill also directs the Department of State and the President to encourage foreign governments and international entities to address NTDs.\n\nAdditionally, the Department of Health and Human Services must take a series of actions relating to NTDs, including promoting initiatives in international forums and establishing a panel to address worm infections.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may award grants to support centers of excellence for research, training, and treatment regarding NTDs."
