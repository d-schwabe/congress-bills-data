  <summary date="2020-05-14T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">COVID-19 Recovery for Seniors and People with Disabilities Act of 2020

This bill modifies Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs for older adults and individuals with disabilities, including by revising eligibility criteria and administrative procedures and by providing supplemental appropriations for certain legal and translation services.

Among other changes, the bill permanently increases relevant income thresholds and asset limits that apply to SSDI, as well as temporarily suspends certain waiting periods that apply to SSDI, SSI, and Medicare coverage to address the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) emergency. The bill also establishes a special Medicare enrollment period and temporarily suspends asset tests used to determine eligibility for certain low-income subsidy programs under the Medicare prescription drug benefit. In addition, the bill delays the application of a reduced federal matching rate under Medicaid for certain personal care services that require an in-home visit.

Additionally, the Social Security Administration (SSA) shall not conduct most disability reviews, collect overpayments, suspend benefits, or undertake specified administrative actions during the COVID-19 emergency. The SSA and the Department of Education must also develop a process to automatically discharge the student loan debt of certain SSDI beneficiaries who have medically determined physical or mental impairments that are unlikely to improve.

In addition, state agencies may modify practices to achieve contactless delivery of food packages to supplement the diets of older, low-income individuals under the Commodity Supplemental Food Program.

The bill also provides funds for the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission to each carry out national campaigns to educate the public about COVID-19 scams.</summary>
