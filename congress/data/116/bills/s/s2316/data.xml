This bill establishes the National Supply Chain Intelligence Center within the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) and contains other provisions related to supply chain intelligence and security.

The center shall (1) aggregate all-source intelligence relating to supply chains; (2) share supply chain-related warnings with the intelligence community, other parts of the federal government, at-risk industry partners, and U.S. allies; and (3) serve as the central resource for supply chain threats and related information.

The President may make funds available to eligible U.S. entities that produce components, products, or technology that will increase supply chain security.

The ODNI shall report to Congress a plan for strengthening supply chain intelligence functions.</summary>
