This requirement applies to flammable, liquid fuel containers of fewer than five gallons that are intended for transport. CPSC may either promulgate a rule or adopt an existing standard. Additionally, CPSC must educate consumers about dangers associated with using or storing such containers near an open flame or a source of ignition. The bill also requires child resistant caps on kerosene and diesel fuel containers. Currently, this only applies to gasoline containers."
