This bill requires an employer to maintain an employee's health care coverage during any period the employee takes family and medical leave when the employer engages in a lockout during the period of leave. (In this bill, "lockout" means a labor dispute involving a work stoppage, in which an employer withholds work from its employees in order to gain a concession from the employees.)</summary>
