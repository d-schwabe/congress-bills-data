The book is used to identify presidentially appointed positions and is published every four years (after each presidential election) by certain congressional committees.\n\nThe bill requires the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to publish the information contained in the PLUM Book on a public website in a format that is easily searchable and that otherwise meets certain data standards. Agencies must upload updated information to the website on a biennial basis. OPM must verify the accuracy of the website's information 90 days after its creation, in coordination with the White House Office of Presidential Personnel.\n\nThe bill terminates publication of the PLUM Book in its current form on January 1, 2024."
