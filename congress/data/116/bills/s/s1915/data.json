For each communication, the log must identify the participants, topic, and purpose.\n\nAdditionally, DOJ must submit semiannual reports to Congress, the DOJ Office of the Inspector General (OIG), and the DOJ Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) containing the communications log for the previous six-month period. DOJ must exclude from the report to Congress any record of a communication in which certain officials participated (e.g., President and Vice President).\n\nThe OIG and the OPR must review the log and notify Congress of inappropriate or improper communications."
