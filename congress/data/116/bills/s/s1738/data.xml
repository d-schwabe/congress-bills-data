  <summary date="2019-06-05T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Workforce Data for Analyzing and Tracking Automation Act of 2019 or the Workforce DATA Act

This bill provides for a study by the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine on measuring the impact of automation on the workforce.

Specifically, the bill requires the Department of Labor to request the academies to enter into an arrangement to conduct a consensus study on how to measure the impact of automation on the workforce, including job creation, job displacement, job retention, and the shifting of skills in demand due to automation.

In addition, Labor must establish an advisory board, or form a subcommittee of an existing advisory board, to provide recommendations on addressing the impact of automation on the workforce.</summary>
