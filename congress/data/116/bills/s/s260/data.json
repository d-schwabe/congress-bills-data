The bill prohibits the issuance of new special certificates that allow payment of subminimum wages to disabled individuals and phases out existing certificates over a six year period.\n\nThe bill directs the Office of Disability Employment of Labor to award grants to provide technical assistance to employers transitioning from special certificates to competitive integrated employment for disabled individuals.\n\nLabor must contract with a nonprofit entity to conduct an evaluation of the impact of the transitioning requirements of this bill."
