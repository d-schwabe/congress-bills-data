  <summary date="2019-01-29T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Transformation to Competitive Employment Act

This bill addresses employment standards for individuals with disabilities.

The bill directs the Department of Labor to award grants to states and certain eligible entities to assist them in transforming their business and program models to support individuals with disabilities by

 operating competitive integrated employment businesses, assisting disabled individuals in finding and retaining work in such employment, and providing integrated employment and integrated community participation and wraparound services for such individuals. The bill prohibits the issuance of new special certificates that allow payment of subminimum wages to disabled individuals and phases out existing certificates over a six year period.

The bill directs the Office of Disability Employment of Labor to award grants to provide technical assistance to employers transitioning from special certificates to competitive integrated employment for disabled individuals.

Labor must contract with a nonprofit entity to conduct an evaluation of the impact of the transitioning requirements of this bill.</summary>
