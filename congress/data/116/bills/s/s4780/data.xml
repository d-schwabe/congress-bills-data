This bill designates certain low-income community areas as qualified Hurricane Laura Recovery Opportunity Zones. Such zones are areas for which a major disaster has been declared before September 30, 2020, and which have been determined by the President to warrant individual or public assistance by reason of Hurricane Laura.

The bill sets forth special rules for the treatment of capital gains in Hurricane Laura Recovery Opportunity Zones. It also expresses the sense of Congress that the rate of tax on income from capital gains in effect on the enactment date of this bill should not be changed.</summary>
