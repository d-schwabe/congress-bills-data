Requirements include (1) testing residents and employees for COVID-19 weekly or before shifts, respectively, and reporting any lack of available testing kits on a daily basis; (2) providing at least two weeks of paid sick leave to each employee; and (3) reporting the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths, including demographic information, on a daily basis.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services\u00a0must also distribute funds to allow states to establish strike teams that may be deployed to SNFs and NFs within 72 hours of three or more COVID-19 diagnoses to help separate those who have been exposed, supervise testing, and ensure enforcement of whistleblower protections, among other needs. Teams must include members of the National Guard, public health officials, medical experts, and representatives of residents and workers."
