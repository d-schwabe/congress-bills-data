This bill expands eligibility for the Marine Gunnery Sergeant John David Fry Scholarship, commonly referred to as the Fry Scholarship, which entitles specified dependents of an active-duty servicemember who died in the line of duty on or after September 11, 2001, to educational assistance under the Post-9/11 GI Bill.

Specifically, the bill expands eligibility for the Fry Scholarship to the following dependents:

 a child or surviving spouse of a servicemember who dies on or after September 11, 2001, serving in a line of duty other than active duty, and a child or surviving spouse of a Selected Reserve member who dies on or after September 11, 2001, from a service-connected disability within four years after the date of the last discharge from active duty.</summary>
