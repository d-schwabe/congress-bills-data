This bill permits a state to enter into an agreement with the Department of Labor under which Labor will temporarily provide 100% of unemployment compensation (UC), including related administrative expenses, to certain individuals in their first week of unemployment, thus eliminating the state requirement that an individual has to wait one week before being eligible for UC.The unemployment must occur in an area for which there is an emergency declaration for such week.

Such agreement shall apply to weeks of unemployment after the agreement is entered into and ends on or before the earlier of (1) January 1, 2022, or (2) the state's compliance with certain federal requirements.</summary>
