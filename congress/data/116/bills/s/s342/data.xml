Next, the bill reauthorizes the Foreign Language and Area Studies Fellowships program. It also revises the program to permit graduate students to receive a stipend for the beginning, intermediate, or advanced study of a foreign language related to the student's area of specialization.

Further, the bill extends the Technological Innovation and Cooperation for Foreign Information Access program. It also modifies&#160;the program, such as by (1) revising the types of available grants, and (2) allowing the Department of Education to establish a national database on international and foreign language education.

Finally, the bill reauthorizes programs related to international business skills and education. Specifically, it reauthorizes the Centers for Business Education program.
