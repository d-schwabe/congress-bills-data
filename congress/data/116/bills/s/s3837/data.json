The State Department may not issue F, M, or J visas to Chinese nationals until DHS has reported to Congress the completed results of the background checks.\n\nDHS shall continuously vet any Chinese national holding an F, M, or J visa who has access to any COVID-19-related research, unless the individual is enrolled in elementary or secondary school."
