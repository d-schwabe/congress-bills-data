This bill allows the use of tax-exempt retirement plan distributions to pay for long-term health care insurance. Specifically, it excludes such distributions from the gross income of an insured individual up to $2,500 for per individual in a taxable year.

It also imposes reporting requirements on plans and insured individuals and requires a description of long-term care insurance arrangements and facts sheets for employers and workers.</summary>
