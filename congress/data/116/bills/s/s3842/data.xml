This bill directs the Department of Transportation (DOT) to establish within the Build America Bureau a five-year rural assistance pilot program to provide assistance and information to eligible entities in rural communities. An eligible entity is an entity located outside of an urbanized area with a population greater than 150,000 or one that may pursue a project located in such an area.

DOT may retain the services of expert firms, including counsel, in the field of municipal and project finance to assist in providing financial, technical, and legal assistance to such entities.

DOT must make publicly available on its website a description of the rural assistance pilot program, including the resources available to eligible entities. Additionally, DOT must develop and make available to the public an online portal through which it may receive program applications on a rolling basis.</summary>
