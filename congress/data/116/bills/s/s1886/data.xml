  <summary date="2019-06-18T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Countering Hezbollah in Lebanon's Military Act of 2019

This bill limits the use of security assistance funds for Lebanon until certain conditions are met. Specifically, 20% of funds appropriated or made available for such security assistance may not be obligated or expended until the President certifies to Congress that (1) the Lebanese Armed Forces have&#160;taken measurable steps to limit or expel Hezbollah-influenced military personnel that have significant influence over the Lebanese Armed Forces' policies or activities, (2) activities of the Lebanese Armed Forces to disarm Hezbollah demonstrate a serious commitment to fulfill United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701 calling for such disarmament, and (3) the Lebanese Armed Forces have&#160;not cooperated or partnered with Hezbollah during the last year.

The President may waive the first two requirements if it is in U.S. national security interest to do so.</summary>
