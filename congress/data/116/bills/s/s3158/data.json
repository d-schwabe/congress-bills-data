The TEACH program awards grants to college students who plan to teach in low-income areas.\n\nThe bill also exempts the TEACH program from sequestration, which is a process of automatic, usually across-the-board spending reductions under which budgetary resources are permanently cancelled to enforce specific budget policy goals."
