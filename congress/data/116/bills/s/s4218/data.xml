This bill extends the status of an issuer of securities as an emerging growth company. Specifically, these issuers will remain emerging growth companies until the later of

 one year after the date of enactment of this bill, the end of the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) emergency declaration period, and the date the issuer would otherwise cease being an emerging growth company. Emerging growth companies (in general, a newly public company with revenues below a specified threshold) are subject to reduced disclosure requirements, among other regulations.</summary>
