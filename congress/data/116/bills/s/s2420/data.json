    "text": "End Child Trafficking Now Act\n\nThis bill imposes restrictions related to adult aliens being admitted into the United States with a minor.\n\nAn adult alien shall not be admitted with a minor unless the adult (1) presents documents and witness testimony proving that the adult is a relative or guardian of the minor, or (2) submits to a DNA test that proves such a relationship. The Department of Homeland Security shall request a DNA test only if the required relationship cannot be established by specified evidence. An adult alien who does not consent to a requested DNA test shall be inadmissible.\n\nIf the required relationship cannot be established and the immigration officer believes the alien is guilty of a felony offense, the officer may arrest the alien adult.\n\nThe bill makes it a crime for an alien adult to knowingly use a minor to whom the adult is not a relative or guardian to enter the United States."
