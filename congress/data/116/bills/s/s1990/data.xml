This bill authorizes the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) to impose a fine on a presidentially appointed employee against whom the Special Counsel determines disciplinary action should be taken for (1) committing a prohibited personnel practice; (2) violating the provision of any law, rule, or regulation, or engaging in certain other conduct within the jurisdiction of the Special Counsel; or (3) knowingly and willfully refusing or failing to comply with an order of the MSPB.

If the Special Counsel determines that such disciplinary action should be taken, the Special Counsel must prepare a written complaint containing such determination and present it to the President. The President shall submit a written response explaining whether the President is taking the recommended disciplinary action and, if not, the reason for not doing so.</summary>
