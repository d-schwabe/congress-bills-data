This bill directs the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), in coordination with the Department of Justice,&#160;to share with state, local, and regional fusion centers release information from a federal correctional facility, including the name, charging date, and expected place and date of release, of individuals who may pose a terrorist threat. Such information shall be for homeland security purposes, and regarding individuals convicted of a federal crime of terrorism.

A fusion center serves as a focal point within the state and local environment for the receipt, analysis, gathering, and sharing of threat-related information between the federal government and state, local, tribal, territorial, and private sector partners.

DHS shall coordinate with federal officials to provide fusion centers with periodic assessments regarding the threat from known or suspected terrorists currently incarcerated.</summary>
