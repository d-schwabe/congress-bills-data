  <summary date="2019-06-25T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Save Affordable Housing Act of 2019 

This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code, with respect to the low-income housing tax credit, to repeal the qualified contract option for a building that received its allocation of housing credit dollar amount before January 1, 2019, or received before that date, a determination from the bond issuer or housing credit agency of its eligibility to receive an allocation of a housing credit dollar amount.

Under current law, properties subject to the low-income housing tax credit are subject to a 30-year affordability period, during which the value of properties is set at a below market rate. The qualified contract option allows property owners, in some cases,&#160;to convert to market rate after 15 years.</summary>
