This bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to develop a suicide risk management and prevention and lethal means training course that is culturally appropriate and addresses the concerns of firearm owners. The VA must make such training course available to members of the public and must update the course at least every two years.

Additionally, the VA must provide the most recent training course at least once every five years to each employee of the Veterans Health Administration who regularly interacts with veterans in the course of their employment.</summary>
