This bill establishes a grant program within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to improve health, prevent and manage chronic health conditions, and reduce health disparities among racial and ethnic minority populations.

Specifically, HHS, in consultation with the Office of Minority Health, must award grants to, or enter into cooperative agreements with, entities that demonstrate relevant experience in, and capacity for, working with such populations. Recipients must use funds for increasing diversity in the public health and health care workforce, enhancing capacity to respond to infectious disease outbreaks, and implementing health improvement efforts.</summary>
