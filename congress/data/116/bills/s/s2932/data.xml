This bill establishes that the copyright owner of a sound recording has the exclusive right to perform the recording through an audio transmission. Currently, the copyright owner's performance right generally only covers digital audio transmission, which excludes certain terrestrial radio stations.

A radio station must obtain express permission from the copyright owner of the sound recording before making such a transmission, unless the transmission consists of a religious assembly or incidental use of the recording.

A radio station with revenues of less than $1 million per year shall pay $500 per year to the copyright owner to obtain such permission to use a sound recording. A public broadcast entity or individual terrestrial broadcast station shall pay no more than $100 per year to obtain permission from the copyright owner.</summary>
