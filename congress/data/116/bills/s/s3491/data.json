Such isolation or quarantine may be due to (1) a regulation by the Office of the Surgeon General concerning the spread of a communicable disease; (2) an order by a state, local, or tribal government; (3) a written recommendation by such government; or (4) voluntary health monitoring pursuant to guidance issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or other applicable public health agency. Employees may enforce this prohibition through civil claims to recover damages and reinstatement of employment, if appropriate. The Department of Labor also may conduct administrative actions and file civil claims on behalf of employees."
