The volunteer may elect to extend such insurance, at the volunteer's expense, until the last day in which the volunteer would be eligible for unemployment benefits under the Relief for Workers Affected by Coronavirus Act. The Department of Labor shall deem a terminated volunteer eligible for such unemployment benefits if the volunteer is unemployed and not eligible for regular or extended unemployment benefits.\n\nExecutive branch departments and agencies with hiring needs, as well as the Corporation for National and Community Service, shall establish expedited processes for hiring and enrolling such terminated Peace Corps volunteers.The Peace Corps shall (1) resume all programs, to the extent possible, as soon as the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided; and (2) establish an expedited process for reenrolling Peace Corps volunteers whose service was terminated due to COVID-19.\n\nThe Peace Corps shall inform exiting volunteers of various health care options available after leaving the Peace Corps."
