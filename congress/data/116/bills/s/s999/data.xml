This bill directs the Office of Science and Technology Policy to convene an interagency entity under the National Science and Technology Council with the responsibility of coordinating federal programs and activities in support of sustainable chemistry. Agencies participating in the entity must carry out specified activities in support of sustainable chemistry, including incorporating sustainable chemistry into existing research, development, demonstration, technology transfer, commercialization, education, and training programs. Sustainable chemistry, also known as green chemistry, is focused on conserving resources and minimizing the generation and use of hazardous substances in chemical processes.</summary>
