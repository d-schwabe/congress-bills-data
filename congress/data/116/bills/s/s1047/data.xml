This bill creates an allowance for a deceased veteran's or deceased service member's surviving spouse who is receiving dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC) from the Department of Veterans Affairs. DIC is a monthly payment made to survivors and dependents of (1) certain veterans, and (2) service members killed while on active military duty. The bill provides a formula for calculating the monthly rate of the allowance based on the DIC amount the spouse is entitled to receive.

Payment amounts under the Survivor Benefit Plan shall not be affected by the implementation of the DIC allowance.</summary>
