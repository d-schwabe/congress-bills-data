This bill requires federal agencies to take specified steps to ensure that individuals with limited English proficiency and people with disabilities can access the services, activities, programs, and benefits of those agencies, particularly during national or public health emergencies or under other specified circumstances.

Specifically, each federal agency shall, within specified timeframes

 conduct demographic assessments of individuals with limited English proficiency and individuals with disabilities who are eligible to be served or likely to be encountered by that agency, establish within the agency a Language Access Working Group, prepare and submit to the Department of Justice (DOJ) an access plan for federally conducted programs and activities, and issue guidance for recipients of federal financial assistance under the agency's jurisdiction. DOJ shall review (1) each plan submitted within 120 days after receipt of the plan, and (2) the most recently submitted plan from each relevant agency not later than 7 days after an emergency has been declared.

Agencies shall ensure stakeholder input to ensure meaningful access.</summary>
