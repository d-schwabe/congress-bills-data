    "text": "Job Creation through Energy Efficient Manufacturing Act\n\nThis bill requires the Department of Energy (DOE) to establish a Financing Energy Efficient Manufacturing Program that provides grants for energy efficiency improvement projects in the manufacturing sector.\n\nThe following types of entities are eligible for grants:\n\n state energy offices; Native American tribes; nonprofit organizations that focus on providing energy efficiency or renewable energy services and receive funding from states, tribes, or utilities; electric cooperative groups; or entities with a public-private partnership under the Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership. The entities that receive grants must then distribute subgrants to certain small- or medium-sized manufacturers (employing no more than 750 employees) located in the same states as the entities. Recipients of subgrants must carry out projects that (1) improve the energy efficiency of the manufacturers, and (2) develop technologies that reduce electricity or natural gas use by the manufacturers.\n\nThe bill establishes labor requirements for projects that receive grant funding under this bill. In addition, grant projects may only use iron and steel products that are produced in the United States, unless DOE grants a waiver of the requirement."
