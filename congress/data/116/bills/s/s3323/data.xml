This bill revises the procedure for expelling members from a federal credit union. Specifically, a member may be expelled for cause pursuant to a policy adopted by a majority vote of a quorum of the directors of a credit union. Currently, a member may be expelled by a two-thirds vote of the credit union membership present at a special meeting.

The expelled member may request reinstatement by the credit union board.

Member conduct that may be cause for expulsion includes

 a loss to the credit union, a violation of the credit union membership agreement, a disruption to the operations of a credit union, fraud or attempted fraud, and other illegal or inappropriate behavior.</summary>
