Family members of veterans and reservists who resided at these military installations are also eligible for hospital care and medical services under this bill.\n\nThe bill also provides a presumption of service connection for veterans and reservists who were exposed to such substances. Under a presumption of service connection, specific conditions diagnosed in veterans are presumed to have been caused by the circumstances of their military service. Health care benefits and disability compensation may then be awarded."
