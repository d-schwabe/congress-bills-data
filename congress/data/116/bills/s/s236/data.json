The report must include the factual findings of the investigation and significant expenditures, explain prosecutorial decisions, and be made publicly available.\n\nAdditionally, a special counsel must submit periodic reports to DOJ and Congress on budgetary requirements and expenditures, personnel, and performance statistics.\n\nFinally, the bill requires DOJ to notify Congress when a special counsel is removed or transferred."
