Specifically, the bill (1) expands available claims and priorities for employees and retirees, and (2) places additional restrictions on the compensation of executives and other high level employees.\n\nWith respect to employee and retiree\u00a0recoveries and losses, the bill\n\n increases the maximum\u00a0value and age\u00a0of specified wage and benefit claims entitled to priority payment; allows certain claims for losses\u00a0related to\u00a0defined contribution plans, if the employer or plan sponsor has committed fraud or otherwise breached its fiduciary duty; allows, as an administrative expense of the estate, severance pay owed to employees and contributions to an employee benefit plan; establishes\u00a0certain restrictions\u00a0regarding the rejection or amendment of a collective bargaining agreement; revises specified procedures related to the reduction or denial of retiree benefits; requires a court, in approving a sale of business assets, to consider the extent to which a bidder has offered to maintain existing jobs and assume benefit obligations; and allows claims related to pension losses. With respect to\u00a0executive compensation, the bill\n\n establishes\u00a0specified limitations related to executive compensation enhancements, prohibits executives from receiving certain retiree benefits if such benefits were reduced or eliminated for other employees or retirees, and revises other requirements related to court approval of such compensation."
