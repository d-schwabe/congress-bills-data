This bill requires state Medicaid programs to cover treatment for COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019). State Medicaid programs must also cover COVID-19 testing and treatment for uninsured individuals. (Currently, state Medicaid programs are required to cover COVID-19 testing for enrollees and have the option to cover testing for uninsured individuals.) Coverage must be provided with no cost-sharing.

Additionally, state Medicaid programs may not impose cost-sharing for COVID-19 vaccines.</summary>
