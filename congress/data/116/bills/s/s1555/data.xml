This bill revises provisions that require the Department of Defense (DOD) and, with respect to the Coast Guard,&#160;the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to operate a program providing individual pre-separation counseling and services to assist members of the Armed Forces who are transitioning to civilian life. The bill's changes include (1) revising various deadlines in the transition program, (2) requiring the use of surveys and electronic systems to track the progress of participating individuals, and (3) establishing a program to provide Armed Forces members with information about the transition program and about career and educational opportunities available during military service.

DOD and DHS must annually report on the furnishing of such pre-separation counseling, information, and services.

The Government Accountability Office must report on service member participation in transition assistance programs at small and remote military installations.</summary>
