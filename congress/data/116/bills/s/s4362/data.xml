  <summary date="2020-07-29T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Emergency Water and Energy is a Human Right Act

This bill creates a grant program, administered by the Department of Health and Human Services, to provide funds to states and Indian tribes to assist low-income households that pay a high proportion of household income for drinking water and wastewater services.

Specifically, states and Indian tribes must provide payments to owners and operators of public water systems and wastewater treatment works to reduce rates charged to low-income households. Owners and operators must also conduct outreach activities to ensure that households are aware of the available rate reduction assistance.

Further, any entity receiving financial assistance under this grant program must ensure that no home energy service, public water system service, or wastewater&#160;treatment works is or remains disconnected or interrupted during the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) public health emergency because of nonpayment.</summary>
