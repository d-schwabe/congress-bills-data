Owners and operators must also conduct outreach activities to ensure that households are aware of the available rate reduction assistance.\n\nFurther, any entity receiving financial assistance under this grant program must ensure that no home energy service, public water system service, or wastewater\u00a0treatment works is or remains disconnected or interrupted during the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) public health emergency because of nonpayment."
