    "text": "Rent Emergencies Leave Impacts on Evicted Families Act or the RELIEF Act \n\nThis bill generally revises housing protections established in response to the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic, including by expanding protections for renters and mortgage holders, providing consumer protections regarding credit reports and utility access, and increasing oversight regarding housing protections. Among other things, the bill\n\n prohibits all evictions and foreclosures for one year; prohibits increases in rent; provides an 18-month grace period for missed rent payments; prohibits landlords and mortgage servicers from reporting missed payments to credit reporting agencies; establishes a credit facility to provide landlords with low-cost, long-term loans to compensate for losses due to reduction in rent payments; establishes a program to assist low-income households in paying utility bills; and provides congressional oversight regarding rental property assistance. The bill also generally revises bankruptcy provisions, including by excluding COVID-19 aid from property subject to bankruptcy proceedings."
