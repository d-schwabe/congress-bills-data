This bill revises requirements related to stock buybacks (i.e., a company repurchasing shares of common stock). Specifically, issuers of securities must provide an annual dividend to non-executive employees in certain circumstances. The calculation of this dividend is based on (1) the amount the issuer spends on stock buybacks, (2) increases in dividends, and (3) any special dividends.

Additionally, an issuer is prohibited from repurchasing shares unless details of the buyback are disclosed to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including the rationale for the repurchase. The buyback must also comply with certain purchasing requirements. The bill lowers the allowed daily amount of repurchased shares. Executive officers may not sell shares for seven days beginning on the date of an announced buyback, subject to certain exceptions.

The SEC may enforce these provisions. Employees are afforded a private right of action against an issuer regarding required employee dividends.</summary>
