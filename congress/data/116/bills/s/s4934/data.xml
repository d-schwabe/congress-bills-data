This bill requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to conduct a study and report on the potential exposure to mercury vapor from PMA flooring (synthetic flooring made using phenylmercuric acetate as a catalyst). The study and report must also cover the prevalence of PMA flooring in schools and establish appropriate industrial hygiene monitoring steps to prevent or interdict mercury vapor exposure. The report must be available on a publicly available EPA website.</summary>
