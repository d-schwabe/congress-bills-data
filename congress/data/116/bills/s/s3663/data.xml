  <summary date="2020-05-07T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">COVID-19 Consumer Data Protection Act of 2020This bill generally prohibits covered entities from collecting, processing, or transferring an individual's&#160;personally identifiable information for the purpose of contact&#160;tracing with respect to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) without first obtaining the individual's affirmative consent to use such information. Applicable personally identifiable&#160;information includes, but is not limited to, precise geolocation data, long-lasting digital identifiers of individuals, and personal health information. However, such&#160;information does not include data&#160;that is de-identified, related to employee health screening for on-site entry, or publicly available.

Covered entities, which include businesses, common carriers, and certain&#160;nonprofit organizations,&#160;also must provide a mechanism for individuals to revoke prior affirmative consent.</summary>
