This coverage requirement also applies to federal health care programs including Medicare, Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program, veterans and military personnel health benefits, and federal employee health benefits.\n\nAdditionally, the bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to reimburse, through the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund, health care providers for the cost of providing diagnosis and treatment for COVID-19 to individuals without health insurance."
