This bill creates certain administrative and judicial remedies for federal employees whose right to provide information to Congress is interfered with or denied.

Under current law, federal employees have the right to petition or furnish information to Congress or to individual Members of Congress, and this right may not be interfered with or denied. The bill explicitly allows employees who are aggrieved by a violation of this right to seek administrative remedies that are currently available to whistleblowers who are fired or experience other forms of retaliation. The bill also establishes a private right of action for aggrieved employees, including the option of a jury trial, if an administrative remedy is not issued within 210 days of a complaint being made.

The bill applies to employees and contractors of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government, including members of the intelligence community.</summary>
