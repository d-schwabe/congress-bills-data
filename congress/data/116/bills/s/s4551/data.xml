This bill allows individuals who are personally injured by a riot, or who suffer property damage because of a riot, to sue those responsible in federal court and receive triple damages.

Specifically, the bill allows victims to sue any person that (1) caused the injury or property damage; (2) traveled from out of state or used, for example, the internet, telephone, television, or mail with the intent to incite, organize, or participate in the riot; and (3) did incite, organize, or participate in the riot or attempted to do so.</summary>
