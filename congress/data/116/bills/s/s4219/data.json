(VFR are a set of regulations under which a pilot operates an aircraft in weather conditions generally clear enough to allow the pilot to see where the aircraft is going.)\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) must conduct a rulemaking proceeding to promulgate a new special air traffic rule for civil helicopters operating VFR along the North Shore and South Shore of Long Island, New York in accordance with specified requirements of the bill.\n\nA person who pilots a civil helicopter operating VFR along Long Island, New York's northern shoreline or southern shoreline may deviate from the North Shore Helicopter Route or South Shore Helicopter Route requirements: (1) for safety or weather conditions; or (2) when transitioning to or from a destination or point of landing, except for on the North Shore Helicopter Route when departing from or arriving to certain locations.\n\n If safety or weather conditions cause a person piloting a civil helicopter operating VFR to deviate from either route, the person must submit a one page report to the FAA identifying the condition not later than 14 days after landing."
