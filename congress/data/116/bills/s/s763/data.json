The fund must be used for a program that finances projects that reduce the economic, social, and environmental impact of the adverse effects of climate change.\n\nThe Climate Change Advisory Commission, established by this bill, must provide recommendations and guidelines for the program and identify categories of the most cost-effective investments and projects that emphasize multiple benefits to commerce, human health, and ecosystems."
