However, such changes are not excepted if the EPA determines the increase in the maximum achievable hourly emission rate from such change would cause an adverse effect on human health or the environment.\n\nConstruction for a major emitting facility (a type of stationary source) does not include a change at such a facility that does not result in a significant emissions increase or a significant net emissions increase.\n\nIn relation to major emitting facilities in nonattainment areas, the terms modifications and modified do not include changes at such facilities that do not result in a significant emissions increase or a significant net emissions increase."
