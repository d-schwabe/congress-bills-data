This bill directs the U.S. Coast Guard to conduct icebreaking operations in the Great Lakes in accordance with specific performance standards.

Specifically, the Coast Guard must

 keep channels and harbors in the Great Lakes open to navigation not less than 90% of the hours that commercial vessels and ferries attempt to transit ice-covered waterways; in a year in which the Great Lakes are not open to navigation because of ice of a thickness that occurs on average only once every 10 years, keep channels and harbors open to navigation at least 70% of the hours that commercial vessels and ferries attempt to transit ice-covered waterways; and coordinate Great Lakes icebreaking operations with operators of commercial vessels. The Coast Guard must prioritize icebreaking in the United States waters of the Great Lakes over icebreaking in Canadian waters of the Great Lakes.</summary>
