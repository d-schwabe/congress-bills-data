This bill requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to establish a Robocall Division within the Enforcement Bureau.

The Robocall Division shall be tasked with (1) ensuring consumer protection and compliance with federal laws relating to robocalls; (2) serving as a line of communication between the federal government and the communications industry, as well as between the FCC and related federal agencies, to coordinate efforts to eliminate robocalls; and (3) managing and addressing consumer complaints regarding robocalls.
