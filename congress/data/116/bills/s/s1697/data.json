The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act altered these provisions to require a state Medicaid program to cover former foster youth from other states until the age of 26; such changes apply to\u00a0former foster youth\u00a0who reach the age of 18 on or after January 1, 2023.\n\nThe bill instead applies these changes to\u00a0former foster youth\u00a0who reach the age of 18 on or after the date of enactment of this bill."
