Two of the data points we're seeking can be identified and extracted using their variable names within the JSON. These include the congressional session ('congress'), the bill number ('number'). The third datapoint of interest is the URL to the web page containing the full text of the bill, which we are gathering from congress.gov using string interpolation. We then use the .append method to store these variables in our new bills_data list and finally convert this list into a tabular format (a data frame) using the function pd.DataFrame.
